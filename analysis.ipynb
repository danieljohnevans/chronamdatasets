      "\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\n",
