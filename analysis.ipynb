       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The &lt;em&gt;N.W. Ayer &amp;amp; Son&amp;#8217;s American Newspaper Annual&lt;/em&gt; described Abbeville County simply as a &amp;#8220;cotton growing district,&amp;#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&amp;#8217;s economy for most of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; in 1844. Its competitor, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press &lt;/em&gt;(later known as the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, Puckett having previously edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Southern Rights&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Fant having apprenticed with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the Civil War, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and merged it with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &amp;#8220;Bourbons,&amp;#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the &lt;em&gt;Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the &lt;a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 1925, the newspaper merged with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067666/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Evening Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and became the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn86063799/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe short-lived weekly &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, the leading weekly newspapers the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Columbia Daily Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry Weekly Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for news items. He published only six issues of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, four of which have survived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&amp;#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has continued through several title changes into the present. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; began as the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenwood Saluda Argus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1881. Although only a few issues of the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus &lt;/em&gt;have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus&lt;/em&gt; and renamed it the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edgefield Advertiser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the &lt;em&gt;American Newspaper Directory&lt;/em&gt; recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sumter Watchman and Southron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &amp;#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninety-Six Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

The &lt;em&gt;N.W.

Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;.

       "0  <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> in 1844. Its competitor, the <em>Abbeville Independent Press </em>(later known as the <em>Abbeville Press</em>) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the <em>Abbeville Independent Press</em>, Puckett having previously edited the <a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"><em>Anderson Southern Rights</em> <em>Advocate</em></a> and Fant having apprenticed with the <a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"><em>Anderson Gazette</em></a>. During the Civil War, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and merged it with the <em>Abbeville Press</em> to create the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the <em>Press and Banner</em> steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &#8220;Bourbons,&#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"><em>Abbeville Medium</em></a>, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the <em>Press and Banner</em> generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the <em>Independent Press</em>, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the <em>Press and Banner</em>, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the <a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"><em>Press and Banner</em></a>.

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, the leading weekly newspapers the <a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"><em>Abbeville Press</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"><em>Abbeville Banner</em></a> had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the <a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"><em>Columbia Daily Phoenix</em></a>, <a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"><em>Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer</em></a>, and <a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"><em>Newberry Weekly Herald</em></a> for news items. He published only six issues of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, four of which have survived.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em> was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the <em>Abbeville Press</em> with the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> to create the <a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"><em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em></a>, which has continued through several title changes into the present. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</p>   \n",

The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> began as the <a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"><em>Greenwood Saluda Argus</em></a> in 1881. Although only a few issues of the <em>Saluda Argus </em>have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the <em>Saluda Argus</em> and renamed it the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly <a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"><em>Edgefield Advertiser</em></a>, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the <em>American Newspaper Directory</em> recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the <em>Abbeville Medium</em> and <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"><em>Anderson Intelligencer</em></a> announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"><em>Sumter Watchman and Southron</em></a> reported that the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&#8221;&#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the <a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"><em>Ninety-Six Guardian</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"><em>Newberry News</em></a>. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</p>   \n",
       "3  <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>.

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The short-lived weekly Abbeville Bulletin (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Abbeville Messenger (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19 th century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the Abbeville Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</td>\n",

Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Zajedni č ar (“Fraternalist”) was established in 1904 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. It served as the official organ of the National Croatian Society, which had formed in 1894 as the Croatian Association and became known as Croatian Fraternal Union of America (CFU; Hrvatska bratska zajednica) in 1926, following the merger of four separate organizations: the National Croatian Society, the Croatian League of Illinois, the St. Joseph Society in Kansas City, Kansas, and the New Croatian Society in Whiting, Indiana. The Zajedni č ar , also known as “Z” to its readers, was issued monthly until 1909 when it became a weekly. Its primary purpose was to facilitate communication between the CFU’s Home Office in Pittsburgh and lodges and members living across the United States, Canada, Croatia, and in other areas in the Croatian diaspora. Around 1935, the Zajedni č ar moved to nearby Youngstown, Ohio, but by the 1950s, it had returned to Pittsburgh. Ohio was home to over 70,000 Croats by 1970. Most had originally settled along Lake Erie, obtaining low-paying industrial jobs and building communities in Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown and other cities in northeast Ohio. Like many eastern and southern European immigrants, Croats had left their homeland in search of better financial opportunities and to escape political oppression. Croatia had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, then became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (known as Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929), alongside Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Elections following World War II placed the kingdom under Communist rule as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Throughout this long period of economic difficulties and political unrest, the CFU was loyal to the United States – its members purchased war bonds, aided war relief efforts, and even enlisted in the armed forces – while supporting efforts to establish an independent Croatia. The Zajedni č ar denounced Yugoslavian President Josep Broz Tito’s regime, and although ambivalent about Yugoslavian freedom and unity in its English-language section, its Croatian-language section openly advocated for Croatia’s independence, a dream that was not realized until 1991. As the official organ of the CFU, the Zajedničar reported on the many efforts of the fraternal organization to improve the lives of Croatian-Americans, such as sponsoring insurance funds, scholarships, sports clubs, and an even an orphanage. Activities of local CFU lodges or nests ( odsjeka ) were also regularly featured, allowing readers to find information about local musical concerts, dance performances, parties, and festivals that celebrated and preserved Croatian national folklore. Often, these events would highlight traditional tamburitsa orchestras and kolo dance groups. CFU members were encouraged to contribute content to the newspaper, and it was not uncommon to see photographs and brief descriptions of new members, as well as reports of births, deaths, weddings, and other personal events. Articles in the Zajedni č ar also covered the national and local administration of the CFU through membership campaigns, elections, fundraising, and conventions. The Zajedničar ‘s one-time motto, “All For One and One For All” (Svi Za Jednog-Jedan Za Sve), demonstrates CFU’s emphasis on serving its community, as do the newspaper’s regular reports on CFU-sponsored activities and Croatian-American businesses and families in the Pittsburgh area and beyond. In fact, geographic coverage ranged from western Canada, California, and Washington to Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. By the early 1970s, the newspaper boasted over 65,000 readers, and the CFU’s membership was around 110,000. Today, the CFU continues to serve its 60,000 members, and the Zajedni č ar, now a biweekly, is the only Croatian newspaper in the United States. Radnička</td>\n",

It operated under the auspices of Zwiazek Narodowo Polski (ZNP) or the Polish National Alliance. The ZNP encouraged organizational unity among Polish immigrants. Throughout the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, Zgoda faithfully reported on developments in Poland, encouraging Poles in the mother country to hold onto their traditions and identity amidst Russian occupation. Zgoda also featured a front-page spread dedicated to the labor movement. In 1908, this content was transferred to the ZNP’s daily publication, Dziennik ludowy (“People’s Daily”) . With this change, Zgoda began to focus primarily on news related to the ZNP. Although Catholicism was a monumental part of Polish-American life, Zgoda tended to deviate from the teachings of the church. This set it apart from other Polish-American papers such as the Dziennik Chicagoski (“Chicago Daily News”) , Dziennik Związkowy (“Polish Daily News”) , and the Gazeta Polska Katolicka (“The Polish Catholic Gazette”) . An article in Zgoda titled “Precz ze Zdrajcami” (“Down with Traitors”) contended that priests and bishops that should not employ their “holiness” as a position of comfort, but rather that they should use their influence to enable the voice of the people. In 1900, Zgoda began publishing a special weekly issue called Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast (“Harmony: Women’s edition”), for the purpose of bringing together women in the immigrant community. In the first issue, the editor expounded that a society without women would be short-lived and weak. Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast tended to be much less politically aggressive than Zgoda: Wydanie dla mężczyzn (“Harmony: Men’s Edition”), which was also launched in 1900. With many articles submitted by its female readers, Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast reported on women’s rallies, included recipes, home remedies and health, childcare tips and tricks, and warned against dangers present in the developing cities of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Conversely, Zgoda: Wydanie dla mężczyzn focused specifically on politics, ranging from local to international issues. An early issue of the new men’s edition headlined “Zasady w Polityce” (“Rules in Politics”). Other headlines included “Resurrecturi,” which compared spiritual laziness to politics, as well as “Zapowiesci nowej wojny” on the “Talk of a New War” in Africa. Other popular topics include updates on Congress, financial and economic news, and short biographies on famous politicians and war heroes, including Jezy (“George”) Washington. In the 1920s, Zgoda began publishing some English-language articles in acknowledgment of the inevitable Americanization of Chicago’s Polish community. This process continued in succeeding decades. By 1977, half of its pages were published in English. Zgoda is still in publication today as the ZNP’s quarterly magazine.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In 1881, Zgoda (“Harmony”) appeared as a weekly newspaper for the Polish community in the Chicago metropolitan area. It operated under the auspices of Zwiazek Narodowo Polski (ZNP) or the Polish National Alliance. The ZNP encouraged organizational unity among Polish immigrants. Throughout the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, Zgoda faithfully reported on developments in Poland, encouraging Poles in the mother country to hold onto their traditions and identity amidst Russian occupation. Zgoda also featured a front-page spread dedicated to the labor movement. In 1908, this content was transferred to the ZNP’s daily publication, Dziennik ludowy (“People’s Daily”) . With this change, Zgoda began to focus primarily on news related to the ZNP. Although Catholicism was a monumental part of Polish-American life, Zgoda tended to deviate from the teachings of the church. This set it apart from other Polish-American papers such as the Dziennik Chicagoski (“Chicago Daily News”) , Dziennik Związkowy (“Polish Daily News”) , and the Gazeta Polska Katolicka (“The Polish Catholic Gazette”) . An article in Zgoda titled “Precz ze Zdrajcami” (“Down with Traitors”) contended that priests and bishops that should not employ their “holiness” as a position of comfort, but rather that they should use their influence to enable the voice of the people. In 1900, Zgoda began publishing a special weekly issue called Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast (“Harmony: Women’s edition”), for the purpose of bringing together women in the immigrant community. In the first issue, the editor expounded that a society without women would be short-lived and weak. Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast tended to be much less politically aggressive than Zgoda: Wydanie dla mężczyzn (“Harmony: Men’s Edition”), which was also launched in 1900. With many articles submitted by its female readers, Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast reported on women’s rallies, included recipes, home remedies and health, childcare tips and tricks, and warned against dangers present in the developing cities of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Conversely, Zgoda: Wydanie dla mężczyzn focused specifically on politics, ranging from local to international issues. An early issue of the new men’s edition headlined “Zasady w Polityce” (“Rules in Politics”). Other headlines included “Resurrecturi,” which compared spiritual laziness to politics, as well as “Zapowiesci nowej wojny” on the “Talk of a New War” in Africa. Other popular topics include updates on Congress, financial and economic news, and short biographies on famous politicians and war heroes, including Jezy (“George”) Washington. In the 1920s, Zgoda began publishing some English-language articles in acknowledgment of the inevitable Americanization of Chicago’s Polish community. This process continued in succeeding decades. By 1977, half of its pages were published in English. Zgoda is still in publication today as the ZNP’s quarterly magazine.</td>\n",

The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.   \n",

The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.   \n",

Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W.

       "3675  The Zajedni č ar (“Fraternalist”) was established in 1904 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. It served as the official organ of the National Croatian Society, which had formed in 1894 as the Croatian Association and became known as Croatian Fraternal Union of America (CFU; Hrvatska bratska zajednica) in 1926, following the merger of four separate organizations: the National Croatian Society, the Croatian League of Illinois, the St. Joseph Society in Kansas City, Kansas, and the New Croatian Society in Whiting, Indiana. The Zajedni č ar , also known as “Z” to its readers, was issued monthly until 1909 when it became a weekly. Its primary purpose was to facilitate communication between the CFU’s Home Office in Pittsburgh and lodges and members living across the United States, Canada, Croatia, and in other areas in the Croatian diaspora. Around 1935, the Zajedni č ar moved to nearby Youngstown, Ohio, but by the 1950s, it had returned to Pittsburgh. Ohio was home to over 70,000 Croats by 1970. Most had originally settled along Lake Erie, obtaining low-paying industrial jobs and building communities in Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown and other cities in northeast Ohio. Like many eastern and southern European immigrants, Croats had left their homeland in search of better financial opportunities and to escape political oppression. Croatia had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, then became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (known as Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929), alongside Bosnia & Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Elections following World War II placed the kingdom under Communist rule as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Throughout this long period of economic difficulties and political unrest, the CFU was loyal to the United States – its members purchased war bonds, aided war relief efforts, and even enlisted in the armed forces – while supporting efforts to establish an independent Croatia. The Zajedni č ar denounced Yugoslavian President Josep Broz Tito’s regime, and although ambivalent about Yugoslavian freedom and unity in its English-language section, its Croatian-language section openly advocated for Croatia’s independence, a dream that was not realized until 1991. As the official organ of the CFU, the Zajedničar reported on the many efforts of the fraternal organization to improve the lives of Croatian-Americans, such as sponsoring insurance funds, scholarships, sports clubs, and an even an orphanage. Activities of local CFU lodges or nests ( odsjeka ) were also regularly featured, allowing readers to find information about local musical concerts, dance performances, parties, and festivals that celebrated and preserved Croatian national folklore. Often, these events would highlight traditional tamburitsa orchestras and kolo dance groups. CFU members were encouraged to contribute content to the newspaper, and it was not uncommon to see photographs and brief descriptions of new members, as well as reports of births, deaths, weddings, and other personal events. Articles in the Zajedni č ar also covered the national and local administration of the CFU through membership campaigns, elections, fundraising, and conventions. The Zajedničar ‘s one-time motto, “All For One and One For All” (Svi Za Jednog-Jedan Za Sve), demonstrates CFU’s emphasis on serving its community, as do the newspaper’s regular reports on CFU-sponsored activities and Croatian-American businesses and families in the Pittsburgh area and beyond. In fact, geographic coverage ranged from western Canada, California, and Washington to Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. By the early 1970s, the newspaper boasted over 65,000 readers, and the CFU’s membership was around 110,000. Today, the CFU continues to serve its 60,000 members, and the Zajedni č ar, now a biweekly, is the only Croatian newspaper in the United States. Radnička   \n",

It operated under the auspices of Zwiazek Narodowo Polski (ZNP) or the Polish National Alliance. The ZNP encouraged organizational unity among Polish immigrants. Throughout the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, Zgoda faithfully reported on developments in Poland, encouraging Poles in the mother country to hold onto their traditions and identity amidst Russian occupation. Zgoda also featured a front-page spread dedicated to the labor movement. In 1908, this content was transferred to the ZNP’s daily publication, Dziennik ludowy (“People’s Daily”) . With this change, Zgoda began to focus primarily on news related to the ZNP. Although Catholicism was a monumental part of Polish-American life, Zgoda tended to deviate from the teachings of the church. This set it apart from other Polish-American papers such as the Dziennik Chicagoski (“Chicago Daily News”) , Dziennik Związkowy (“Polish Daily News”) , and the Gazeta Polska Katolicka (“The Polish Catholic Gazette”) . An article in Zgoda titled “Precz ze Zdrajcami” (“Down with Traitors”) contended that priests and bishops that should not employ their “holiness” as a position of comfort, but rather that they should use their influence to enable the voice of the people. In 1900, Zgoda began publishing a special weekly issue called Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast (“Harmony: Women’s edition”), for the purpose of bringing together women in the immigrant community. In the first issue, the editor expounded that a society without women would be short-lived and weak. Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast tended to be much less politically aggressive than Zgoda: Wydanie dla mężczyzn (“Harmony: Men’s Edition”), which was also launched in 1900. With many articles submitted by its female readers, Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast reported on women’s rallies, included recipes, home remedies and health, childcare tips and tricks, and warned against dangers present in the developing cities of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Conversely, Zgoda: Wydanie dla mężczyzn focused specifically on politics, ranging from local to international issues. An early issue of the new men’s edition headlined “Zasady w Polityce” (“Rules in Politics”). Other headlines included “Resurrecturi,” which compared spiritual laziness to politics, as well as “Zapowiesci nowej wojny” on the “Talk of a New War” in Africa. Other popular topics include updates on Congress, financial and economic news, and short biographies on famous politicians and war heroes, including Jezy (“George”) Washington. In the 1920s, Zgoda began publishing some English-language articles in acknowledgment of the inevitable Americanization of Chicago’s Polish community. This process continued in succeeding decades. By 1977, half of its pages were published in English. Zgoda is still in publication today as the ZNP’s quarterly magazine.   \n",

Other headlines included “Resurrecturi,” which compared spiritual laziness to politics, as well as “Zapowiesci nowej wojny” on the “Talk of a New War” in Africa. Other popular topics include updates on Congress, financial and economic news, and short biographies on famous politicians and war heroes, including Jezy (“George”) Washington. In the 1920s, Zgoda began publishing some English-language articles in acknowledgment of the inevitable Americanization of Chicago’s Polish community. This process continued in succeeding decades. By 1977, half of its pages were published in English. Zgoda is still in publication today as the ZNP’s quarterly magazine.   \n",

It operated under the auspices of Zwiazek Narodowo Polski (ZNP) or the Polish National Alliance. The ZNP encouraged organizational unity among Polish immigrants. Throughout the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, Zgoda faithfully reported on developments in Poland, encouraging Poles in the mother country to hold onto their traditions and identity amidst Russian occupation. Zgoda also featured a front-page spread dedicated to the labor movement. In 1908, this content was transferred to the ZNP’s daily publication, Dziennik ludowy (“People’s Daily”) . With this change, Zgoda began to focus primarily on news related to the ZNP. Although Catholicism was a monumental part of Polish-American life, Zgoda tended to deviate from the teachings of the church. This set it apart from other Polish-American papers such as the Dziennik Chicagoski (“Chicago Daily News”) , Dziennik Związkowy (“Polish Daily News”) , and the Gazeta Polska Katolicka (“The Polish Catholic Gazette”) . An article in Zgoda titled “Precz ze Zdrajcami” (“Down with Traitors”) contended that priests and bishops that should not employ their “holiness” as a position of comfort, but rather that they should use their influence to enable the voice of the people. In 1900, Zgoda began publishing a special weekly issue called Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast (“Harmony: Women’s edition”), for the purpose of bringing together women in the immigrant community. In the first issue, the editor expounded that a society without women would be short-lived and weak. Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast tended to be much less politically aggressive than Zgoda: Wydanie dla mężczyzn (“Harmony: Men’s Edition”), which was also launched in 1900. With many articles submitted by its female readers, Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast reported on women’s rallies, included recipes, home remedies and health, childcare tips and tricks, and warned against dangers present in the developing cities of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The short-lived weekly Abbeville Bulletin (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Abbeville Messenger (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19 th century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the Abbeville Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "0  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.   \n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.   \n",

The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.   \n",
       "3  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina.
