       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The &lt;em&gt;N.W. Ayer &amp;amp; Son&amp;#8217;s American Newspaper Annual&lt;/em&gt; described Abbeville County simply as a &amp;#8220;cotton growing district,&amp;#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&amp;#8217;s economy for most of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; in 1844. Its competitor, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press &lt;/em&gt;(later known as the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, Puckett having previously edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Southern Rights&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Fant having apprenticed with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the Civil War, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and merged it with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &amp;#8220;Bourbons,&amp;#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the &lt;em&gt;Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the &lt;a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 1925, the newspaper merged with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067666/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Evening Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and became the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn86063799/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe short-lived weekly &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, the leading weekly newspapers the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Columbia Daily Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry Weekly Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for news items. He published only six issues of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, four of which have survived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&amp;#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;.

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; began as the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenwood Saluda Argus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1881. Although only a few issues of the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus &lt;/em&gt;have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus&lt;/em&gt; and renamed it the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edgefield Advertiser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the &lt;em&gt;American Newspaper Directory&lt;/em&gt; recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sumter Watchman and Southron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &amp;#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninety-Six Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

The &lt;em&gt;N.W. Ayer &amp;amp; Son&amp;#8217;s American Newspaper Annual&lt;/em&gt; described Abbeville County simply as a &amp;#8220;cotton growing district,&amp;#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&amp;#8217;s economy for most of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;.

During the Civil War, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and merged it with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869.

Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the &lt;em&gt;Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association.

       "0  <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> in 1844. Its competitor, the <em>Abbeville Independent Press </em>(later known as the <em>Abbeville Press</em>) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the <em>Abbeville Independent Press</em>, Puckett having previously edited the <a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"><em>Anderson Southern Rights</em> <em>Advocate</em></a> and Fant having apprenticed with the <a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"><em>Anderson Gazette</em></a>. During the Civil War, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and merged it with the <em>Abbeville Press</em> to create the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the <em>Press and Banner</em> steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &#8220;Bourbons,&#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"><em>Abbeville Medium</em></a>, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the <em>Press and Banner</em> generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the <em>Independent Press</em>, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the <em>Press and Banner</em>, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the <a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"><em>Press and Banner</em></a>.

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, the leading weekly newspapers the <a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"><em>Abbeville Press</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"><em>Abbeville Banner</em></a> had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the <a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"><em>Columbia Daily Phoenix</em></a>, <a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"><em>Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer</em></a>, and <a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"><em>Newberry Weekly Herald</em></a> for news items. He published only six issues of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, four of which have survived.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em> was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the <em>Abbeville Press</em> with the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> to create the <a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"><em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em></a>, which has continued through several title changes into the present. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</p>   \n",

The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> began as the <a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"><em>Greenwood Saluda Argus</em></a> in 1881. Although only a few issues of the <em>Saluda Argus </em>have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the <em>Saluda Argus</em> and renamed it the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly <a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"><em>Edgefield Advertiser</em></a>, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the <em>American Newspaper Directory</em> recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the <em>Abbeville Medium</em> and <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"><em>Anderson Intelligencer</em></a> announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"><em>Sumter Watchman and Southron</em></a> reported that the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&#8221;&#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the <a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"><em>Ninety-Six Guardian</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"><em>Newberry News</em></a>. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</p>   \n",
       "3  <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>.

       "      <td>For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer &amp; Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The short-lived weekly Abbeville Bulletin (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Abbeville Messenger (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19 th century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the Abbeville Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</td>\n",

Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium . The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</td>\n",

       "0  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner .

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher). When Hugh Wilson established the Abbeville Bulletin , the leading weekly newspapers the Abbeville Press and Abbeville Banner had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the Columbia Daily Phoenix , Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer , and Newberry Weekly Herald for news items. He published only six issues of the Abbeville Bulletin , four of which have survived. Evidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the Abbeville Bulletin . The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina’s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss. On August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the Abbeville Press . The Abbeville Bulletin was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the Abbeville Press with the Abbeville Banner to create the Abbeville Press and Banner , which has continued through several title changes into the present. The Abbeville Bulletin , by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.   \n",

The Abbeville Messenger began as the Greenwood Saluda Argus in 1881. Although only a few issues of the Saluda Argus have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the Saluda Argus and renamed it the Abbeville Messenger . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884. Despite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly Edgefield Advertiser , the Abbeville Messenger never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the American Newspaper Directory recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the Abbeville Medium and Abbeville Press and Banner boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the Anderson Intelligencer announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the Sumter Watchman and Southron reported that the Abbeville Messenger had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed “to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.”  The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887. From a historical perspective, the Abbeville Messenger is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the Ninety-Six Guardian and Newberry News . He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The Abbeville Messenger may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.   \n",
       "3  For nearly a century, the Abbeville Press and Banner (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The N.W. Ayer & Son’s American Newspaper Annual described Abbeville County simply as a “cotton growing district,” which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county’s economy for most of the 19 th century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916. The Abbeville Press and Banner began as two weekly newspapers, the Abbeville Banner and Abbeville Press . Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the Abbeville Banner in 1844. Its competitor, the Abbeville Independent Press (later known as the Abbeville Press ) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the Abbeville Independent Press , Puckett having previously edited the Anderson Southern Rights Advocate and Fant having apprenticed with the Anderson Gazette . During the Civil War, the Abbeville Banner suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the Abbeville Press , turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s. After the war, Wilson and Lee bought the Abbeville Banner and merged it with the Abbeville Press to create the Abbeville Press and Banner . The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the Press and Banner steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the “Bourbons,” or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the Abbeville Medium , which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the Press and Banner generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions. Several of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the Independent Press , served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the Press and Banner , served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66. Starting in the 1920s, the Abbeville Press and Banner underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the Press and Banner . In 1925, the newspaper merged with the Abbeville Evening Medium and became the Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium .

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The &lt;em&gt;N.W. Ayer &amp;amp; Son&amp;#8217;s American Newspaper Annual&lt;/em&gt; described Abbeville County simply as a &amp;#8220;cotton growing district,&amp;#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&amp;#8217;s economy for most of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; in 1844. Its competitor, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press &lt;/em&gt;(later known as the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, Puckett having previously edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Southern Rights&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Fant having apprenticed with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the Civil War, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and merged it with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &amp;#8220;Bourbons,&amp;#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the &lt;em&gt;Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the &lt;a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 1925, the newspaper merged with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067666/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Evening Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and became the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn86063799/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, the leading weekly newspapers the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Columbia Daily Phoenix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry Weekly Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for news items. He published only six issues of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, four of which have survived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&amp;#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has continued through several title changes into the present.

Although only a few issues of the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus &lt;/em&gt;have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the &lt;em&gt;Saluda Argus&lt;/em&gt; and renamed it the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edgefield Advertiser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the &lt;em&gt;American Newspaper Directory&lt;/em&gt; recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sumter Watchman and Southron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &amp;#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninety-Six Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newberry News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Messenger&lt;/em&gt; may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The &lt;em&gt;N.W. Ayer &amp;amp; Son&amp;#8217;s American Newspaper Annual&lt;/em&gt; described Abbeville County simply as a &amp;#8220;cotton growing district,&amp;#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&amp;#8217;s economy for most of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; began as two weekly newspapers, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; in 1844. Its competitor, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press &lt;/em&gt;(later known as the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, Puckett having previously edited the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Southern Rights&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Fant having apprenticed with the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anderson Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the Civil War, the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt;, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Banner&lt;/em&gt; and merged it with the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press&lt;/em&gt; to create the &lt;em&gt;Abbeville Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &amp;#8220;Bourbons,&amp;#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abbeville Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt; generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the &lt;em&gt;Independent Press&lt;/em&gt;, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the &lt;em&gt;Press and Banner&lt;/em&gt;, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association.

It served as the official organ of the National Croatian Society, which had formed in 1894 as the Croatian Association and became known as Croatian Fraternal Union of America (CFU; Hrvatska bratska zajednica) in 1926, following the merger of four separate organizations: the National Croatian Society, the Croatian League of Illinois, the St. Joseph Society in Kansas City, Kansas, and the New Croatian Society in Whiting, Indiana. The &lt;em&gt;Zajedni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#269;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ar&lt;/em&gt;, also known as &amp;#8220;Z&amp;#8221; to its readers, was issued monthly until 1909 when it became a weekly. Its primary purpose was to facilitate communication between the CFU&amp;#8217;s Home Office in Pittsburgh and lodges and members living across the United States, Canada, Croatia, and in other areas in the Croatian diaspora. Around 1935, the &lt;em&gt;Zajedni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#269;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ar&lt;/em&gt; moved to nearby Youngstown, Ohio, but by the 1950s, it had returned to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tOhio was home to over 70,000 Croats by 1970. Most had originally settled along Lake Erie, obtaining low-paying industrial jobs and building communities in Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown and other cities in northeast Ohio. Like many eastern and southern European immigrants, Croats had left their homeland in search of better financial opportunities and to escape political oppression. Croatia had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, then became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (known as Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929), alongside Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Elections following World War II placed the kingdom under Communist rule as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Throughout this long period of economic difficulties and political unrest, the CFU was loyal to the United States &amp;#8211; its members purchased war bonds, aided war relief efforts, and even enlisted in the armed forces &amp;#8211; while supporting efforts to establish an independent Croatia. The &lt;em&gt;Zajedni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#269;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ar &lt;/em&gt;denounced Yugoslavian President Josep Broz Tito&amp;#8217;s regime, and although ambivalent about Yugoslavian freedom and unity in its English-language section, its Croatian-language section openly advocated for Croatia&amp;#8217;s independence, a dream that was not realized until 1991.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAs the official organ of the CFU, the &lt;em&gt;Zajedni&amp;#269;ar &lt;/em&gt;reported on the many efforts of the fraternal organization to improve the lives of Croatian-Americans, such as sponsoring insurance funds, scholarships, sports clubs, and an even an orphanage. Activities of local CFU lodges or nests (&lt;em&gt;odsjeka&lt;/em&gt;) were also regularly featured, allowing readers to find information about local musical concerts, dance performances, parties, and festivals that celebrated and preserved Croatian national folklore. Often, these events would highlight traditional &lt;em&gt;tamburitsa &lt;/em&gt;orchestras and &lt;em&gt;kolo &lt;/em&gt;dance groups. CFU members were encouraged to contribute content to the newspaper, and it was not uncommon to see photographs and brief descriptions of new members, as well as reports of births, deaths, weddings, and other personal events. Articles in the &lt;em&gt;Zajedni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#269;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ar&lt;/em&gt; also covered the national and local administration of the CFU through membership campaigns, elections, fundraising, and conventions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tThe &lt;em&gt;Zajedni&amp;#269;ar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s one-time motto, &amp;#8220;All For One and One For All&amp;#8221; (Svi Za Jednog-Jedan Za Sve), demonstrates CFU&amp;#8217;s emphasis on serving its community, as do the newspaper&amp;#8217;s regular reports on CFU-sponsored activities and Croatian-American businesses and families in the Pittsburgh area and beyond. In fact, geographic coverage ranged from western Canada, California, and Washington to Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. By the early 1970s, the newspaper boasted over 65,000 readers, and the CFU&amp;#8217;s membership was around 110,000. Today, the CFU continues to serve its 60,000 members, and the &lt;em&gt;Zajedni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#269;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ar, &lt;/em&gt;now a biweekly, is the only Croatian newspaper in the United States.&amp;#160;Radni&amp;#269;ka&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

It operated under the auspices of Zwiazek Narodowo Polski (ZNP) or the Polish National Alliance. The ZNP encouraged organizational unity among Polish immigrants. Throughout the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, &lt;em&gt;Zgoda&lt;/em&gt; faithfully reported on developments in Poland, encouraging Poles in the mother country to hold onto their traditions and identity amidst Russian occupation. &lt;em&gt;Zgoda&lt;/em&gt; also featured a front-page spread dedicated to the labor movement. In 1908, this content was transferred to the ZNP&amp;#8217;s daily publication, &lt;a href=\"/item/sn83045093\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dziennik ludowy &lt;/em&gt;(&amp;#8220;People&amp;#8217;s Daily&amp;#8221;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;With this change, &lt;em&gt;Zgoda &lt;/em&gt;began to focus primarily on news related to the ZNP.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tAlthough Catholicism was a monumental part of Polish-American life, &lt;em&gt;Zgoda&lt;/em&gt; tended to deviate from the teachings of the church. This set it apart from other Polish-American papers such as the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn83045747\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dziennik Chicagoski &lt;/em&gt;(&amp;#8220;Chicago Daily News&amp;#8221;)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/item/sn94083572\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dziennik Zwi&amp;#261;zkowy &lt;/em&gt;(&amp;#8220;Polish Daily News&amp;#8221;)&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"/item/sn94054603\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gazeta Polska Katolicka&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#8220;The Polish Catholic Gazette&amp;#8221;)&lt;/a&gt;. An article in &lt;em&gt;Zgoda&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;#8220;Precz ze Zdrajcami&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;Down with Traitors&amp;#8221;) contended that priests and bishops that should not employ their &amp;#8220;holiness&amp;#8221; as a position of comfort, but rather that they should use their influence to enable the voice of the people. In 1900, &lt;em&gt;Zgoda&lt;/em&gt; began publishing a special weekly issue called &lt;em&gt;Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#8220;Harmony: Women&amp;#8217;s edition&amp;#8221;), for the purpose of bringing together women in the immigrant community. In the first issue, the editor expounded that a society without women would be short-lived and weak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\t&lt;em&gt;Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast &lt;/em&gt;tended to be much less politically aggressive than &lt;em&gt;Zgoda: Wydanie dla &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;me&amp;#808;z&amp;#775;czyzn&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#8220;Harmony: Men&amp;#8217;s Edition&amp;#8221;), which was also launched in 1900. With many articles submitted by its female readers, &lt;em&gt;Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast&lt;/em&gt; reported on women&amp;#8217;s rallies, included recipes, home remedies and health, childcare tips and tricks, and warned against dangers present in the developing cities of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Conversely, &lt;em&gt;Zgoda: Wydanie dla &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;me&amp;#808;z&amp;#775;czyzn&lt;/em&gt; focused specifically on politics, ranging from local to international issues. An early issue of the new men&amp;#8217;s edition headlined &amp;#8220;Zasady w Polityce&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;Rules in Politics&amp;#8221;). Other headlines included &amp;#8220;Resurrecturi,&amp;#8221; which compared spiritual laziness to politics, as well as &amp;#8220;Zapowiesci nowej wojny&amp;#8221; on the &amp;#8220;Talk of a New War&amp;#8221; in Africa. Other popular topics include updates on Congress, financial and economic news, and short biographies on famous politicians and war heroes, including Jezy (&amp;#8220;George&amp;#8221;) Washington.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\n\\tIn the 1920s, &lt;em&gt;Zgoda &lt;/em&gt;began publishing some English-language articles in acknowledgment of the inevitable Americanization of Chicago&amp;#8217;s Polish community. This process continued in succeeding decades.

       "0                              <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> in 1844. Its competitor, the <em>Abbeville Independent Press </em>(later known as the <em>Abbeville Press</em>) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the <em>Abbeville Independent Press</em>, Puckett having previously edited the <a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"><em>Anderson Southern Rights</em> <em>Advocate</em></a> and Fant having apprenticed with the <a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"><em>Anderson Gazette</em></a>. During the Civil War, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and merged it with the <em>Abbeville Press</em> to create the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the <em>Press and Banner</em> steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &#8220;Bourbons,&#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"><em>Abbeville Medium</em></a>, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the <em>Press and Banner</em> generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the <em>Independent Press</em>, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the <em>Press and Banner</em>, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the <a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"><em>Press and Banner</em></a>. In 1925, the newspaper merged with the <a href=\"/item/sn93067666/\"><em>Abbeville Evening Medium</em></a> and became the <a href=\"/item/sn86063799/\"><em>Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium</em></a>. The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</p>   \n",

In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, the leading weekly newspapers the <a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"><em>Abbeville Press</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"><em>Abbeville Banner</em></a> had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the <a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"><em>Columbia Daily Phoenix</em></a>, <a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"><em>Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer</em></a>, and <a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"><em>Newberry Weekly Herald</em></a> for news items. He published only six issues of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, four of which have survived.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em> was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the <em>Abbeville Press</em> with the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> to create the <a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"><em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em></a>, which has continued through several title changes into the present. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</p>   \n",

The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> began as the <a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"><em>Greenwood Saluda Argus</em></a> in 1881. Although only a few issues of the <em>Saluda Argus </em>have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the <em>Saluda Argus</em> and renamed it the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly <a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"><em>Edgefield Advertiser</em></a>, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the <em>American Newspaper Directory</em> recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the <em>Abbeville Medium</em> and <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"><em>Anderson Intelligencer</em></a> announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"><em>Sumter Watchman and Southron</em></a> reported that the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&#8221;&#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the <a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"><em>Ninety-Six Guardian</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"><em>Newberry News</em></a>. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</p>   \n",
       "3                              <p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>.

       "3675  <p>\\n\\tThe&#160;<em>Zajedni</em><em>&#269;</em><em>ar</em> (&#8220;Fraternalist&#8221;) was established in 1904 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. It served as the official organ of the National Croatian Society, which had formed in 1894 as the Croatian Association and became known as Croatian Fraternal Union of America (CFU; Hrvatska bratska zajednica) in 1926, following the merger of four separate organizations: the National Croatian Society, the Croatian League of Illinois, the St. Joseph Society in Kansas City, Kansas, and the New Croatian Society in Whiting, Indiana. The <em>Zajedni</em><em>&#269;</em><em>ar</em>, also known as &#8220;Z&#8221; to its readers, was issued monthly until 1909 when it became a weekly. Its primary purpose was to facilitate communication between the CFU&#8217;s Home Office in Pittsburgh and lodges and members living across the United States, Canada, Croatia, and in other areas in the Croatian diaspora. Around 1935, the <em>Zajedni</em><em>&#269;</em><em>ar</em> moved to nearby Youngstown, Ohio, but by the 1950s, it had returned to Pittsburgh.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOhio was home to over 70,000 Croats by 1970. Most had originally settled along Lake Erie, obtaining low-paying industrial jobs and building communities in Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown and other cities in northeast Ohio. Like many eastern and southern European immigrants, Croats had left their homeland in search of better financial opportunities and to escape political oppression. Croatia had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, then became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (known as Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929), alongside Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Elections following World War II placed the kingdom under Communist rule as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Throughout this long period of economic difficulties and political unrest, the CFU was loyal to the United States &#8211; its members purchased war bonds, aided war relief efforts, and even enlisted in the armed forces &#8211; while supporting efforts to establish an independent Croatia. The <em>Zajedni</em><em>&#269;</em><em>ar </em>denounced Yugoslavian President Josep Broz Tito&#8217;s regime, and although ambivalent about Yugoslavian freedom and unity in its English-language section, its Croatian-language section openly advocated for Croatia&#8217;s independence, a dream that was not realized until 1991.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs the official organ of the CFU, the <em>Zajedni&#269;ar </em>reported on the many efforts of the fraternal organization to improve the lives of Croatian-Americans, such as sponsoring insurance funds, scholarships, sports clubs, and an even an orphanage. Activities of local CFU lodges or nests (<em>odsjeka</em>) were also regularly featured, allowing readers to find information about local musical concerts, dance performances, parties, and festivals that celebrated and preserved Croatian national folklore. Often, these events would highlight traditional <em>tamburitsa </em>orchestras and <em>kolo </em>dance groups. CFU members were encouraged to contribute content to the newspaper, and it was not uncommon to see photographs and brief descriptions of new members, as well as reports of births, deaths, weddings, and other personal events. Articles in the <em>Zajedni</em><em>&#269;</em><em>ar</em> also covered the national and local administration of the CFU through membership campaigns, elections, fundraising, and conventions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Zajedni&#269;ar</em>&#8216;s one-time motto, &#8220;All For One and One For All&#8221; (Svi Za Jednog-Jedan Za Sve), demonstrates CFU&#8217;s emphasis on serving its community, as do the newspaper&#8217;s regular reports on CFU-sponsored activities and Croatian-American businesses and families in the Pittsburgh area and beyond. In fact, geographic coverage ranged from western Canada, California, and Washington to Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. By the early 1970s, the newspaper boasted over 65,000 readers, and the CFU&#8217;s membership was around 110,000. Today, the CFU continues to serve its 60,000 members, and the <em>Zajedni</em><em>&#269;</em><em>ar, </em>now a biweekly, is the only Croatian newspaper in the United States.&#160;Radni&#269;ka&#160;</p>   \n",

It operated under the auspices of Zwiazek Narodowo Polski (ZNP) or the Polish National Alliance. The ZNP encouraged organizational unity among Polish immigrants. Throughout the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, <em>Zgoda</em> faithfully reported on developments in Poland, encouraging Poles in the mother country to hold onto their traditions and identity amidst Russian occupation. <em>Zgoda</em> also featured a front-page spread dedicated to the labor movement. In 1908, this content was transferred to the ZNP&#8217;s daily publication, <a href=\"/item/sn83045093\"><em>Dziennik ludowy </em>(&#8220;People&#8217;s Daily&#8221;)</a><em>. </em>With this change, <em>Zgoda </em>began to focus primarily on news related to the ZNP.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlthough Catholicism was a monumental part of Polish-American life, <em>Zgoda</em> tended to deviate from the teachings of the church. This set it apart from other Polish-American papers such as the <a href=\"/item/sn83045747\"><em>Dziennik Chicagoski </em>(&#8220;Chicago Daily News&#8221;)</a>, <a href=\"/item/sn94083572\"><em>Dziennik Zwi&#261;zkowy </em>(&#8220;Polish Daily News&#8221;)</a>, and the <a href=\"/item/sn94054603\"><em>Gazeta Polska Katolicka</em> (&#8220;The Polish Catholic Gazette&#8221;)</a>. An article in <em>Zgoda</em> titled &#8220;Precz ze Zdrajcami&#8221; (&#8220;Down with Traitors&#8221;) contended that priests and bishops that should not employ their &#8220;holiness&#8221; as a position of comfort, but rather that they should use their influence to enable the voice of the people. In 1900, <em>Zgoda</em> began publishing a special weekly issue called <em>Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast</em> (&#8220;Harmony: Women&#8217;s edition&#8221;), for the purpose of bringing together women in the immigrant community. In the first issue, the editor expounded that a society without women would be short-lived and weak.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t<em>Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast </em>tended to be much less politically aggressive than <em>Zgoda: Wydanie dla </em><em>me&#808;z&#775;czyzn</em> (&#8220;Harmony: Men&#8217;s Edition&#8221;), which was also launched in 1900. With many articles submitted by its female readers, <em>Zgoda: Wydania dla niewiast</em> reported on women&#8217;s rallies, included recipes, home remedies and health, childcare tips and tricks, and warned against dangers present in the developing cities of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Conversely, <em>Zgoda: Wydanie dla </em><em>me&#808;z&#775;czyzn</em> focused specifically on politics, ranging from local to international issues. An early issue of the new men&#8217;s edition headlined &#8220;Zasady w Polityce&#8221; (&#8220;Rules in Politics&#8221;). Other headlines included &#8220;Resurrecturi,&#8221; which compared spiritual laziness to politics, as well as &#8220;Zapowiesci nowej wojny&#8221; on the &#8220;Talk of a New War&#8221; in Africa.

       "      <td>The Illinois Issue was a weekly newspaper created in January 1906 for an audience of prohibitionist readers. The Illinois Issue was centered in Chicago and published in Downers Grove. In February 1912, the Illinois Issue ceased production. Starting in July 1913, the Illinois Issue merged with a weekly national publication, the American Issue . Both papers were organized by a political group called the Anti-Saloon League. The American Issue began in 1896. It then ramped up production in 1909 because the town of Westerville, Ohio, donated a printing plant to the Anti-Saloon League to further the cause of alcohol prohibition. The January 19, 1906 edition of the Illinois Issue explains that “Our purpose is to set before the people of this state, in a plain way, plain facts in regard to the greatest enemy of the home, the church and the state, and the greatest lawbreaker in civilization—the organized liquor traffic.” The Illinois Issue , edited by James K. Shields, successfully shaped public opinion within Illinois against the sale of alcohol. Through the use of articles and political cartoons, the Illinois Issue galvanized believers in the temperance cause. Much like the national temperance movement, the Illinois Issue possessed a strong undercurrent of nativist political beliefs. Beginning in 1918, the American Issue became a bi-monthly paper. Illinois ratified the 18 th amendment to the United States constitution in 1919. The passage of the amendment marked the high point of the American Issue ‘s relevance and political influence. The Anti-Saloon League’s publications had a national reach. At its height, the American Issue was circulating nearly 1,800,000 copies per edition. Articles in the American Issue discussed the latest news and the depredations caused by alcohol. For most of its publication period, the editor of the American Issue was Ernest Cherrington, a former teacher who had become a prohibition activist. Headlines such as “Are Speakeasies Ruining our Youth” and “All Illinois Stirred Over Threatened Repeal of Prohibition Enforcement Laws” were crafted by Cherrington to provoke an emotional response to the issue of prohibition. The Great Depression’s economic effects made the idea of tax revenue from liquor sales broadly appealing politically. By 1932, the American Issue spent many of its articles attempting to rebut the claims of anti-prohibition activists. A May 1932 edition argued, “More than ten times as much beer would have to be made as was produced before the war. Or more than ten times the tax would have to be levied on the beer drinker, to bring in the revenue promised by the wets.” The American Issue remained committed to prohibition until the end. Finally, in December 1933, the Eighteenth Amendment was overturned. Prohibition was over, and groups such as the Anti-Saloon League and their publications went into permanent decline. The American Issue ended publication in 1942.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Brookings Register is one of the few continuously published newspapers in South Dakota. The first issues were printed under the Brookings County Sentinel masthead, beginning March 30, 1882. The paper was published weekly on Thursdays in an eight-column, four-page layout for an annual subscription of $1.50. Its printing office was located in Brookings, Dakota Territory, under the ownership of George Breed and Charles D. A. Wright. By March 1883, the Sentinel moved its weekly publication day to Friday. As an introduction to the new paper, the Sentinel editors greeted readers by saying, “In this the first issue of the Brookings County Sentinel , we wish to extend to all upright citizens, and we believe such inhabit our county, the hand of mutual friendship. We are here to represent the whole county of Brookings, from all parts of which we wish to establish a regular correspondence.” The Sentinel’s first issue included market reports and a mortuary report featuring the death of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, along with articles on beer drinking and gerrymandering and a “News in Brief” column. Advertisements were for various businesses in Brookings and the nearby towns of Aurora and Elkton. Ads were listed for the following: stables, barbers, implements, meat markets, photographers, jewelers, harness shops, banks, dry goods, painters, physicians, insurance, lumber, boot makers, and hardware. W. E. Whiting and H. A. Whiting became the Sentinel owners/editors/publishers in May 1888. The paper gradually updated to a six-column, six-page issue by June 1889. George Breed soon repurchased the business, however, and on March 14, 1890, the fifty-second and final issue of the Brookings County Sentinel was published. George Breed began as a newspaper apprentice in Wisconsin, eventually working for several news publications there and in Illinois. He came to Brookings in 1880 to work for the already established Brookings County Press . He was deeply involved in the Brookings community. In 1890, he joined Paul Dutcher in establishing the Brookings Register , merging his Brookings County Sentinel with that publication. Paul Dutcher also started his journalism career in Wisconsin and worked in Iowa prior to coming to Dakota Territory in 1884. He moved to Brookings in 1890 to join George Breed in developing the Brookings Register . A staunch Republican, Dutcher was very active in the community. The Brookings Register started weekly publication on March 21, 1890. The masthead continued listing the volume and issue numbers for the Sentinel as well as the new volume and issue numbers for the Register . Set up as a five-column, eight-page paper, it featured articles on political conventions and legislative terms. The Register was decidedly Republican in its support. Starting October 24, 1894, Dutcher and Breed began publishing the Register on Wednesdays and Saturdays and renamed it the Semi-Weekly Register . Each Wednesday issue had four pages and each Saturday issue contained eight pages. On December 7, 1897, the semi-weekly issues changed publication to Tuesday and Friday. This publishing schedule continued through December 9, 1898. Dutcher and Breed resumed weekly publication on December 15, 1898, under the Brookings Weekly Register name. The eight-page issue, laid out in seven columns, was produced each Thursday. The paper focused on news items from college events, local school events, society news, and current hospitality notes, along with serialized fiction. Directories of county and city officers, churches, and secret societies appeared frequently. Holiday issues often doubled the size of the paper to include all the holiday advertising and special events in the Brookings area. If you needed a touch of humor, a column titled “Jingling Jokelets Joyfully Jibed” would certainly bring a smile. By September 3, 1903, the Brookings Weekly Register transitioned to a six-column, eight-page format. The following week, September 10, 1903, Breed and Dutcher returned to the Brookings Register name. In March 1906, they formed the Register Publishing Company. Up until this time, the subscription price of $1.50 per year had not changed, but on June 21, 1906, the price was lowered to $1.00 per year. In January 1907, the paper was changed to 12 pages, often in two sections, and the price returned to $1.50 annually. By December 1918, the price increased to $2.00 yearly and then in June 1919 to $2.50. The following March, the subscription price went up to $3.00 per year, which remained in effect until January 1923, when the price dropped to a $2.00 rate. Over the years, the Brookings Register remained dedicated to the local community schools and businesses and other major groups that helped build the fifth-largest city in South Dakota. In 1916, Dutcher became the sole owner of the Register publishing business. He noted several associate editors and news associates until E. E Sanders took over the Register in the mid-1920s. As of 2020, the Register was published as a daily paper.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Corvallis [Oregon] Times was founded by Robert Johnson in 1888, who ran the paper for five years, selling in 1893 to Benjamin (B.F.) Irvine. Irvine had begun his newspaper career at age 13 as the correspondent of an Albany (Oregon) weekly, before failing eyesight drove him to farming work. When the opportunity came for him to become editor and owner of the Corvallis Times, Irvine took the post in spite of his vision impairment. He would later remark that he did not regard his failing eyesight as a handicap, but that it somehow aided him to expand his energies and sensibilities. Under Irvine’s ownership, the Times was merged with the Benton Leader in 1893 to serve as “The Official Paper of Benton County.” The eight-page, six-column spread was issued every Wednesday at a subscription cost of $2 per annum. The Times displayed a wide range of content in its early days, touching on news at the local, state, and international levels. The first page included briefs of current events, “important news of all kinds boiled down and arranged for busy people.” Subsequent pages included “Local Lore,” county news “From Our Country Cousins,” special interest stories, and advertisements for local services and business. Advertisements in early issues stated that 6,000 people could be reached through the columns of the Corvallis Times. By 1905, the paper was published on a semiweekly basis every Friday and Tuesday evening, with issues ranging from four to eight pages. Irvine left his helm at the Times in 1908 after joining the Portland Oregon Daily Journal as a staff writer. Later that year, N.R. Moore took over as editor and publisher of the Times, “an independent paper, politically and otherwise, with an ambition to see Corvallis a city of 15,000 and Benton’s population 30,000 in 1915.” With business conditions on the rise in Corvallis, Moore began nursing the idea of starting a daily edition. He was beat to the punch by Charles L. Springer and the Corvallis Weekly Gazette in May 1909, though talks of consolidation soon began between the two papers. The consolidation appealed to both Springer and Moore, since neither the Times nor the Gazette had a plant adequate for the publication of a daily paper. The consolidation of the two papers was announced in the first issue of the Gazette-Times , published July 2, 1909. The proprietors aimed for the partnership to “give to the public the best possible newspaper service that conditions will warrant and to keep making improvements commensurate with the growth of the city and country.” The Gazette-Times ran for only two issues under that name, changing July 16, 1909 to the Weekly Gazette-Times , which was published in conjunction with the Daily Gazette-Times . This paper lineage continues today as the Corvallis Gazette-Times , in publication since 1921.</td>\n",

The Illinois Issue was centered in Chicago and published in Downers Grove. In February 1912, the Illinois Issue ceased production. Starting in July 1913, the Illinois Issue merged with a weekly national publication, the American Issue . Both papers were organized by a political group called the Anti-Saloon League. The American Issue began in 1896. It then ramped up production in 1909 because the town of Westerville, Ohio, donated a printing plant to the Anti-Saloon League to further the cause of alcohol prohibition. The January 19, 1906 edition of the Illinois Issue explains that “Our purpose is to set before the people of this state, in a plain way, plain facts in regard to the greatest enemy of the home, the church and the state, and the greatest lawbreaker in civilization—the organized liquor traffic.” The Illinois Issue , edited by James K. Shields, successfully shaped public opinion within Illinois against the sale of alcohol. Through the use of articles and political cartoons, the Illinois Issue galvanized believers in the temperance cause. Much like the national temperance movement, the Illinois Issue possessed a strong undercurrent of nativist political beliefs. Beginning in 1918, the American Issue became a bi-monthly paper. Illinois ratified the 18 th amendment to the United States constitution in 1919. The passage of the amendment marked the high point of the American Issue ‘s relevance and political influence. The Anti-Saloon League’s publications had a national reach. At its height, the American Issue was circulating nearly 1,800,000 copies per edition. Articles in the American Issue discussed the latest news and the depredations caused by alcohol. For most of its publication period, the editor of the American Issue was Ernest Cherrington, a former teacher who had become a prohibition activist. Headlines such as “Are Speakeasies Ruining our Youth” and “All Illinois Stirred Over Threatened Repeal of Prohibition Enforcement Laws” were crafted by Cherrington to provoke an emotional response to the issue of prohibition. The Great Depression’s economic effects made the idea of tax revenue from liquor sales broadly appealing politically. By 1932, the American Issue spent many of its articles attempting to rebut the claims of anti-prohibition activists. A May 1932 edition argued, “More than ten times as much beer would have to be made as was produced before the war. Or more than ten times the tax would have to be levied on the beer drinker, to bring in the revenue promised by the wets.” The American Issue remained committed to prohibition until the end. Finally, in December 1933, the Eighteenth Amendment was overturned. Prohibition was over, and groups such as the Anti-Saloon League and their publications went into permanent decline. The American Issue ended publication in 1942.   \n",
       "324  The Brookings Register is one of the few continuously published newspapers in South Dakota. The first issues were printed under the Brookings County Sentinel masthead, beginning March 30, 1882. The paper was published weekly on Thursdays in an eight-column, four-page layout for an annual subscription of $1.50. Its printing office was located in Brookings, Dakota Territory, under the ownership of George Breed and Charles D. A. Wright. By March 1883, the Sentinel moved its weekly publication day to Friday. As an introduction to the new paper, the Sentinel editors greeted readers by saying, “In this the first issue of the Brookings County Sentinel , we wish to extend to all upright citizens, and we believe such inhabit our county, the hand of mutual friendship. We are here to represent the whole county of Brookings, from all parts of which we wish to establish a regular correspondence.” The Sentinel’s first issue included market reports and a mortuary report featuring the death of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, along with articles on beer drinking and gerrymandering and a “News in Brief” column. Advertisements were for various businesses in Brookings and the nearby towns of Aurora and Elkton. Ads were listed for the following: stables, barbers, implements, meat markets, photographers, jewelers, harness shops, banks, dry goods, painters, physicians, insurance, lumber, boot makers, and hardware. W. E. Whiting and H. A. Whiting became the Sentinel owners/editors/publishers in May 1888. The paper gradually updated to a six-column, six-page issue by June 1889. George Breed soon repurchased the business, however, and on March 14, 1890, the fifty-second and final issue of the Brookings County Sentinel was published. George Breed began as a newspaper apprentice in Wisconsin, eventually working for several news publications there and in Illinois. He came to Brookings in 1880 to work for the already established Brookings County Press . He was deeply involved in the Brookings community. In 1890, he joined Paul Dutcher in establishing the Brookings Register , merging his Brookings County Sentinel with that publication. Paul Dutcher also started his journalism career in Wisconsin and worked in Iowa prior to coming to Dakota Territory in 1884. He moved to Brookings in 1890 to join George Breed in developing the Brookings Register . A staunch Republican, Dutcher was very active in the community. The Brookings Register started weekly publication on March 21, 1890. The masthead continued listing the volume and issue numbers for the Sentinel as well as the new volume and issue numbers for the Register . Set up as a five-column, eight-page paper, it featured articles on political conventions and legislative terms. The Register was decidedly Republican in its support. Starting October 24, 1894, Dutcher and Breed began publishing the Register on Wednesdays and Saturdays and renamed it the Semi-Weekly Register . Each Wednesday issue had four pages and each Saturday issue contained eight pages. On December 7, 1897, the semi-weekly issues changed publication to Tuesday and Friday. This publishing schedule continued through December 9, 1898. Dutcher and Breed resumed weekly publication on December 15, 1898, under the Brookings Weekly Register name. The eight-page issue, laid out in seven columns, was produced each Thursday. The paper focused on news items from college events, local school events, society news, and current hospitality notes, along with serialized fiction. Directories of county and city officers, churches, and secret societies appeared frequently. Holiday issues often doubled the size of the paper to include all the holiday advertising and special events in the Brookings area. If you needed a touch of humor, a column titled “Jingling Jokelets Joyfully Jibed” would certainly bring a smile. By September 3, 1903, the Brookings Weekly Register transitioned to a six-column, eight-page format. The following week, September 10, 1903, Breed and Dutcher returned to the Brookings Register name. In March 1906, they formed the Register Publishing Company. Up until this time, the subscription price of $1.50 per year had not changed, but on June 21, 1906, the price was lowered to $1.00 per year. In January 1907, the paper was changed to 12 pages, often in two sections, and the price returned to $1.50 annually. By December 1918, the price increased to $2.00 yearly and then in June 1919 to $2.50. The following March, the subscription price went up to $3.00 per year, which remained in effect until January 1923, when the price dropped to a $2.00 rate. Over the years, the Brookings Register remained dedicated to the local community schools and businesses and other major groups that helped build the fifth-largest city in South Dakota. In 1916, Dutcher became the sole owner of the Register publishing business. He noted several associate editors and news associates until E. E Sanders took over the Register in the mid-1920s. As of 2020, the Register was published as a daily paper.   \n",

Irvine. Irvine had begun his newspaper career at age 13 as the correspondent of an Albany (Oregon) weekly, before failing eyesight drove him to farming work. When the opportunity came for him to become editor and owner of the Corvallis Times, Irvine took the post in spite of his vision impairment. He would later remark that he did not regard his failing eyesight as a handicap, but that it somehow aided him to expand his energies and sensibilities. Under Irvine’s ownership, the Times was merged with the Benton Leader in 1893 to serve as “The Official Paper of Benton County.” The eight-page, six-column spread was issued every Wednesday at a subscription cost of $2 per annum. The Times displayed a wide range of content in its early days, touching on news at the local, state, and international levels. The first page included briefs of current events, “important news of all kinds boiled down and arranged for busy people.” Subsequent pages included “Local Lore,” county news “From Our Country Cousins,” special interest stories, and advertisements for local services and business. Advertisements in early issues stated that 6,000 people could be reached through the columns of the Corvallis Times. By 1905, the paper was published on a semiweekly basis every Friday and Tuesday evening, with issues ranging from four to eight pages. Irvine left his helm at the Times in 1908 after joining the Portland Oregon Daily Journal as a staff writer. Later that year, N.R. Moore took over as editor and publisher of the Times, “an independent paper, politically and otherwise, with an ambition to see Corvallis a city of 15,000 and Benton’s population 30,000 in 1915.” With business conditions on the rise in Corvallis, Moore began nursing the idea of starting a daily edition. He was beat to the punch by Charles L. Springer and the Corvallis Weekly Gazette in May 1909, though talks of consolidation soon began between the two papers. The consolidation appealed to both Springer and Moore, since neither the Times nor the Gazette had a plant adequate for the publication of a daily paper. The consolidation of the two papers was announced in the first issue of the Gazette-Times , published July 2, 1909. The proprietors aimed for the partnership to “give to the public the best possible newspaper service that conditions will warrant and to keep making improvements commensurate with the growth of the city and country.” The Gazette-Times ran for only two issues under that name, changing July 16, 1909 to the Weekly Gazette-Times , which was published in conjunction with the Daily Gazette-Times . This paper lineage continues today as the Corvallis Gazette-Times , in publication since 1921.   \n",
