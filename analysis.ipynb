       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tIn 1847 William B. Scott, a free black, traveled to East Tennessee with his family from their home in North Carolina. After a brief stay in Knoxville, Scott moved to Blount County where he worked as a saddle and harness maker. At the start of the Civil War, Scott moved his family back to Knoxville, where they befriended Reverend Thomas Humes, former editor for the <a href=\"/item/sn85038534/\"><em>Knoxville Register</em></a>. Humes arranged for Scott and his son, William B. Scott, Jr., to apprentice as printers at the paper.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1865, the Scott family moved to Nashville where Scott, Sr. was one of the delegates to the Colored Men&#8217;s Convention, which, amongst other causes, lobbied for the freedman&#8217;s right to vote. During his time in Nashville, Scott and his son established the state&#8217;s first African American newspaper, the <a href=\"/item/sn83025745/\"><em>Colored Tennessean</em></a>. Within a year, Scott realized that most of the paper&#8217;s support came from East Tennessee, so he moved the paper to Blount County, where in October 1867, he printed the first issue of the <a href=\"/item/sn83025728/\"><em>Maryville Republican</em></a>. At the time, Maryville had no other newspapers, so although the <em>Republican </em>circulated amongst the county&#8217;s few blacks, the majority of subscribers were white. The paper&#8211;a weekly&#8211;&#8220;advocated equal political, economic and educational opportunities for blacks, but rejected the pursuit of social equality with whites.&#8221; Editorial control was initially held by Richard C. Tucker and Moses L. McConnell but later went to William B. Scott, Jr. Outlining the paper&#8217;s purpose, the second issue&#8217;s editorial stated its commitment to Radical Republicanism, the type that &#8220;recognizes and believes in the universal brotherhood &#8220;by nature&#8221; of all mankind [&#8230;] and that <em>no </em>man has any right to trade and trafic [sic] in human flesh; [&#8230;] and industrial worth should be man&#8217;s passport to favor and respect, without any regard to race, color, or previous condition.&#8221; With the exception of brief competition from others, Scott&#8217;s paper remained the only newspaper in Blount County for a decade. In the early 1870s, William B. Scott, Jr. became publisher of the <em>Republican </em>and the town&#8217;s name was dropped from the masthead. Scott, Sr., returned to his saddle and harness making business but remained at the paper in an editorial role.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWilliam B. Scott, Sr. was devoted to serving his community (regardless of race), and in 1869 he was elected mayor of Maryville. He was also instrumental in establishing the town&#8217;s Freedman&#8217;s Normal Institute. In 1872, Scott, Sr. and Yardley Warner established the monthly <a href=\"/item/sn85042538/\"><em>Maryville Monitor</em></a>. Warner, a black Quaker, had recently arrived from Massachusetts to help establish the Freedman&#8217;s Institute. The two men used the paper&#8217;s editorials to build support and raise funds for the Freedmen&#8217;s Institute. The paper focused on education issues and had a literary slant; subscribers were encouraged to contribute to the publication.&#160;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBy the mid 1870s, Scott had become disillusioned with the Republican Party. He felt that the state Republicans were not doing enough for blacks. In 1876, Scott supported the Democratic presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden, as he believed he would bring blacks and whites closer politically. Scott, Sr. was invited to give speeches in support of Tilden in several states. To further show his support for the Democratic Party, in 1879 Scott Sr. established the <em>Blount County Democrat</em>. The masthead described the paper&#8217;s contents as, &#8220;News, Miscellaneous Home Readings and Blount County Industries.&#8221; Advertising often dominated the publication, and on occasions a single ad occupied the whole front page. Publication ceased in 1883.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNote: A portion of the issues digitized for this newspaper were microfilmed as part of the&#160;<a href=\"https://lccn.loc.gov/2010218177\">Miscellaneous Negro newspapers microfilm collection</a>, a 12 reel collection containing issues of African American newspapers published in the U.S. throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tWhen Joseph DeFord established the village of Bluffton, Ohio, in the 1830s, he first named it &#8220;Shannon.&#8221; In either 1861 or 1872, to avoid confusion with another Shannon, Ohio, residents renamed the village &#8220;Bluffton,&#8221; after the town in Indiana from where many of the residents had immigrated. Bluffton sits halfway between Lima and Findlay on the border of their respective counties, Allen and Hancock, in northwest Ohio. Abundant hardwood in the area sparked Bluffton&#8217;s first commercial industry. When oil deposits were found in the area, the industrial character of the town changed to accommodate mills, refineries, foundries, and factories. Despite Bluffton&#8217;s small population, a train station eventually popped up there, and its presence probably contributed to the success of manufacturing there.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Bluffton News</em> is the longest-running newspaper in Bluffton, Ohio, and it still publishes today. One other paper, known at different times as the <em>Bluffton Times</em> and the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85034414/\"><em>Bluffton Standard</em></a>, published briefly in the village before moving to Dunkirk, Ohio, in 1875. That summer, Nelson Wilbur Cunningham moved from Lima to Bluffton to establish the <em>Bluffton News</em> in the absence of other newspapers. Cunningham envisioned this seven-column weekly paper to be politically independent and focused on local news. The 1880 population of Bluffton was 1,290, and in 1885 the <em>Bluffton News</em> had a circulation of about 1,100, suggesting it was widely circulated in the village. When Cunningham switched to the banking business, his successors, Jesse Huber in 1891 and N. Heminger in 1892, continued Cunningham&#8217;s editorial style. Heminger published the paper for eight years before transferring to the <em>Findlay Courier</em>. He sold the paper to B. F. Biery in 1900, who passed it to his son, Clarence Biery. The Bierys published the <em>Bluffton News</em> in the same manner until Clarence&#8217;s retirement in 1952, when he sold it to Milton I. Edwards, who still currently owns the paper.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn addition to municipal events, the <em>Bluffton News</em> publishes birth announcements, obituaries, and church event calendars. Social news, book chapters, and reprinted stories from previous decades entertain readers. Practical advertisements for groceries and household goods are common. During WWII, the <em>Bluffton News</em> kept an updated column on current mailing addresses for soldiers shipped out from the village area. As the primary newspaper for Bluffton for several decades, the <em>Bluffton News</em> mostly covers what appealed to local interests. It focuses on local farmers, workers, and school district updates and events.</p>',\n",

In 1863, the federal government constructed a new one to address conflicts among settlers, gold miners, and surrounding Native tribes&#8212;especially important because the town of Boise acted as a staging area for mining activity. In 1864, Boise was incorporated as the Idaho Territory&#8217;s capital city, a designation it retained when Idaho was granted statehood in 1890.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t<em>The Boise Citizen</em> was published every Friday from 1906 to 1910. In 1906, it ran with four pages and five columns, changing to four pages with six columns from 1907 to 1910. Fred Floed and Co. was the publisher in 1906. Fred Floed was listed as editor and M. W. Floed as manager from 1907 to 1910. The <em>Citizen</em> saw itself as a booster for Boise and the rest of the state. In its first issue the editor wrote, &#8220;In all those matters appertaining to up building of the city of Boise and the State of Idaho <em>The Citizen</em> will be intensely earnest and loyal&#8230;&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlthough it was the successor to Boise&#8217;s <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88056033/\"><em>Republican</em></a> newspaper, the <em>Citizen</em> identified itself as a Democratic publication. It had a strong focus on national and state politics and expressed its staunch partisan views clearly and often. The editors also frequently expressed anger toward Mormon politicians in Idaho&#8217;s legislature, claiming that Mormon legislators formed a strong voting bloc and brought too much of their church into their politics.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Citizen</em> folded in 1910. Fred Floed was quoted in another Boise paper, the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82006834/\"><em>Idaho Daily Statesman</em></a>, saying that financial hardships forced him to cease publishing. The <em>Statesman</em> also cited rumors of a new Democratic newspaper being started in Boise as another possible reason for the <em>Citizen</em>&#8216;s closure. Floed expressed hope that he would be able to print The <em>Citizen</em> again, but he was unable to. Instead, he founded another Democratic newspaper, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88056105/\"><em>The New Freedom</em></a>, in 1913. Floed managed <em>The New Freedom</em> until poor health forced his retirement in 1919.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Bolet&#237;n mercantil de Puerto Rico</em> first appeared on March 2, 1839, published as the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn91099738\"><em>Bolet&#237;n Instructivo y mercantil de Puerto Rico</em></a><em>, </em>in San Juan. The Puerto Rico scholar Antonio S. Pedreira, in the voluminous <em>El periodismo en Puerto Rico</em>, underlined its importance as &#8220;a newspaper of transcendental significance in the history of newspapers in Puerto Rico&#8221;. The <em>Bolet&#237;n mercantil</em> is regarded as one of the most important newspapers, second to the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2013201074\"><em>Gaceta</em></a>, published in Puerto Rico during the last of the four centuries of Spanish domination on the island. It started as a bi-weekly publication, eventually becoming a daily paper.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Spanish colonial establishment had two basic means of communication: the government&#8217;s <em>Gaceta,</em> and the <em>Bolet&#237;n mercantil</em>, which was supported by and represented the prevailing Spanish commercial and land interests in Puerto Rico. The <em>Bolet&#237;n</em>brought to the forefront, from a conservative stance, the daily life of the Spaniards and their descendants in Puerto Rico. It served as an important resource to study the conservative pro-Spanish political currents in the colony. Even in the context of the military dictatorship imposed on Puerto Rico by Spain throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century (stemming from the 16<sup>th</sup> century), the <em>Bolet&#237;n mercantil</em> allowed space to a much wider spectrum of topics.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe point of view and interests of the merchants, who also handled finances (in the absence of banks until the 1890s) are reflected in editorials, articles, and position statements throughout. They are also grouped as conservatives in the Partido Conservador (1869), shortly after renamed Partido Incondicional Espa&#241;ol (Unconditional Spanish Party). At least two pages of every issue are full of information on mercantile and merchant movements, economic production and activities, commodities and prices in Puerto Rico, and its relations with Spain and the world market (including European countries, the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America). Other topics covered include the activities of the Ateneo (main cultural institution), the Spanish Casino (social club), and daily incidents of the governors. The paper also covered changing movements and political currents in Spain and reproduced official documents and speeches from the Cortes (Spanish congress in Madrid). It reported on political events, such as the 1887 Componte (referring to a method of torture) under governor Romualdo Palacios, and accused the Autonomist Party of subversion.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs Pedreira noted, given the personal cultural interests of editors Santiago Dalmau and Ignacio Guasp, several issues of the <em>Bolet&#237;n</em> include poems, sonnets, dramas, short stories, and literary reviews. Likewise, we find frequent announcements of theater performances, identification of actors/actresses, singers, musicians, and orchestras.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Bolet&#237;n mercantil</em> published articles, news and advertisements regarding technology and inventions. There are plenty of drawings and photographs of technological devices within the industrial context, making this a very important source for the study of the history of technology both within Puerto Rico and worldwide.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSeveral announcements for books, textbooks, school supplies, and their prices are found in this publication, providing a glimpse of the literature that circulated in the colony during this time. Other advertisements from the selling of land, hotel accommodations, and restaurants appear throughout.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Bolet&#237;n</em> serves as an important source of information about Puerto Rico in the historical crossroad of the Spanish- American War of 1898, the military government of 1898-1900, and the new political and economic directions taken under United States colonial rule in the first two decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It published several pages in English, mainly international news. Once the U.S. civil administration began, with the Foraker Act of 1900, the <em>Bolet&#237;n</em> informed its readers about the decisions taken by the Executive Council and the C&#225;mara de Delegados (House of Representatives). It also reported the wars in the Philippines and in Cuba, and congratulated the latter for achieving independence in 1902.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tBrothers John S. and Thomas J. Butler founded the <em>Boise News</em> in Idaho City, Boise County, Idaho Territory, in September 1863. Originally named Bannock City, Idaho City is located 36 miles northeast of Boise and began as a mining boom town. To avoid being confused with Bannack, Montana, the town&#8217;s name was changed. The <em>Boise News </em>commented on February 20, 1864, &#8220;The good people of Bannock&#8230; were astonished on Sunday morning, to wake and find themselves in a new city, but not among strangers&#8211;by some transmutation, the whole population, houses and all, were in Idaho City.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Butler brothers printed their paper on a hand press purchased from the <a href=\"/item/sn88085420\"><em>Statesman </em></a>in Walla Walla, which had also been used to publish the <a href=\"/item/sn83025138\"><em>Morning</em> <em>Oregonian</em></a>. The <em>Boise News</em> ran as a weekly, originally published on Tuesdays, but switched to Saturdays in November 1863. It consisted of four pages with five columns and pledged to be &#8220;strictly independent in politics.&#8221; The <em>News</em> advocated for the advancement of Idaho City, including regular mail service for the town and the building of a canal from the Payette River to aid in mining development. The <em>News</em> also urged for the capital to be removed from Lewiston to southern Idaho, stating that &#8220;even our neighboring agricultural city of Boise&#8221; would be a more suitable capital than the &#8220;trading post&#8221; of Lewiston. In August 1864, the Butlers added a &#8220;Gordon&#8217;s patent lightning press&#8221; to their operation, a printing machine that could churn out two thousand impressions per hour.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the autumn of 1864, Isaac H. Bowman and Henry Clay Street approached the Butler brothers with an offer to buy the printing plant. Bowman and Street had published a Democratic campaign paper entitled the <em>Idaho Crisis</em> using the <em>Boise News&#8217;</em> printing equipment. They threatened to start a rival Democratic paper in Idaho City if the Butlers refused to sell. The farewell note from the Butlers in the final issue of the <em>Boise News</em>, on October 22, 1864, stated, &#8220;the time has arrived when in order to further succeed in publishing a newspaper it is necessary to drive, or be driven, into politics, an employment that the undersigned have no relish for.&#8221; Reportedly, the Butlers had made $20,000 on publishing the <em>Boise News</em> in its 57-week lifespan. Bowman and Clay bought out the <em>News&#8217;</em> printing equipment and began publication of their Democratic <a href=\"/item/sn82015407\"><em>Idaho World </em></a>the next week.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\t<a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99062017/\"><em>The Bon Homme County Independent</em></a> (aka <em>The Independent</em>) started its newspaper life October 6, 1904 in Tabor, Bon Homme County, South Dakota. W. A Glasner, the managing editor and publisher, created the six-column, eight-page, weekly paper, published every Thursday. The first issue&#8217;s front page stated, &#8220;This is the Bon Homme County Independent. It has come to stay; it speaks for itself and we leave the rest to you.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe paper&#8217;s first print run of 1,000 copies was distributed with a notation that an annual subscription would cost $1.50. The paper was shared with surrounding communities, encouraging others to visit the fertile agricultural area with a high percentage of tillable land near the Missouri River.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTabor&#8217;s central location in Bon Homme County was easily accessed by the Platte branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul railroads. The tracks had been set six years after the town of Tabor organized in April 1872.  Most of the settlers reaching Tabor were of southern Bohemian (Czech) or Slovakian descent. The<em> Independent </em>referred to the Czech residents as being sturdy, honest, intellectual, and moral people. With Catholicism being the chief religion of this immigrant community, many events revolved around church-related activities. The church constructed the St Wenceslau&#8217;s Academy, a day school and boarding school that provided education and dormitory facilities to students from kindergarten through grade 12.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen <em>The Independent</em> originated, South Dakota had already become a state with Pierre as its temporary capital. Several other cities challenged Pierre&#8217;s location, including Huron and Mitchell. Mr. Glasner chose to support Mitchell in this cause and to rebuke Pierre&#8217;s potential as a state capital location. In November 1904, an election was held to determine the capital location. All nearby bets were for Mitchell to win by a landslide, however, Pierre remained the permanent capital. <em>The Independent</em> did not report the results until two weeks later with a short note on page six.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t<em>The Bon Homme County Independent </em>was turned over to Joseph Anton Dvorak February 23, 1905. He served as the editor, publisher, and proprietor. The paper layout remained eight pages by six columns. The annual cost of $1.50 continued until January 3, 1918 when it was increased to $2.00.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAt least two pages were syndicated stories and columns with patent medicine advertising. Local and surrounding business advertisements were primarily featured. These ads included services for physician/surgeon, hotel, blacksmith, contractor, plasterer/mason, general store, hardware store, implement dealer, meat market, barber/hairdresser, harness maker, photographer, real estate agent, bank, livery, drug store, furniture store, restaurant, bakery, and nursery. There were also many ads for brewing companies and saloons with at least three being featured each week.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStarting in March 1905, Dvorak began printing two pages in his native Czech language. This section was titled &#268;esk&#233; Odd&#283;len&#237;, which translates as Czech Department. These pages included around the town hospitality news (&#268;esk&#233; Zpr&#225;vy) as well as short articles and want ads. Occasionally, a local obituary was included. A few of the advertisements on these pages were also in Czech. Most of the same information was included in the English portion of the paper.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn February 6, 1913, the paper became known as the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99062018/\"><em>Tabor Independent</em></a>. J. A. Dvorak continued as its editor and publisher for many more years. While the paper reported on national and international people and events, its focus was always on serving Tabor and the surrounding Bon Homme County communities.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tLocated alongside the Mississippi River, in the heart of the fertile Yazoo-Mississippi River Delta in western Mississippi, Bolivar County was established in 1836. On the eve of the Civil War, the county ranked fourteenth in the state in cotton production relying almost exclusively on the labor of enslaved people to achieve that benchmark. Consequently, since the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the county has had a significant African-American majority. After the war, editor of the short-lived newspaper <em>the Floreyville Star</em>, Blanche Kelso Bruce, emerged as a state leader in the Republican Party eventually serving as the first full-term African-American United States senator (1875-81). Walter Sillers, Jr., segregationist, lawyer, and Mississippi state representative (1916-66) also called Rosedale home. Rosedale, briefly known as Floreyville, is the older of two county seats.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Bolivar County Democrat</em> was established in 1887 and, for a time in its 82-year run, co-existed with African-American newspapers in the county including the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87082832/\"><em>Southern Advocate</em></a> (1933-41?) in nearby Mound Bayou. Long-time editor Albert David Linnell guided the newspaper for 25 years. After his death in 1928, his wife, Lois A. Linnell, edited the <em>Democrat</em> for another 15 years. The weekly was usually published on Saturdays in its first four decades, and after 1914, it expanded from four to eight pages. The <em>Bolivar County Democrat</em> printed some international and national news, but focused more on state and local news, announcements, and advertisements; it occasionally carried legal notices. In the mid-teens, general interest articles increased and serialized stories were added. By the 1920s, there were regular columns on farming topics and sometimes an entire woman&#8217;s page. As its name implies, the newspaper supported the Democratic Party. Its final issue was published on February 27, 1969; it was then sold to the <em>Bolivar Commercial</em> published in Cleveland, the other county seat.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tContent of the <em>Democrat</em> in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries is what might be expected in a paper representing a minority that held the economic and political power in the county. While some news and articles noted accomplishments of certain African Americans, such as an article praising Blanche Kelso Bruce in the October 25, 1902 issue, many news items about the local African-American citizens were not complimentary. Perhaps telling of the attitude of most white Bolivar residents was a reprinted editorial about the &#8220;Negro problem&#8221; written by an unidentified northern reporter in the November 3, 1906 issue. In a region where cotton was the primary crop, articles about its production and advice on the control of the devastating boll weevil regularly appeared. Also, not surprisingly in a county bordering the Mississippi River, news about flood control predominated; this included tracking relevant legislation and publishing the minutes of the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the <em>Democrat</em> chronicled the development of the town of Rosedale reporting on the establishment of municipal services such as electricity, graded streets, a waterworks system, and a fire department. In addition to chronicling the rise of Walter Sillers, Jr., the <em>Bolivar County Democrat</em> also reported news of other members of his prominent family.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe town of Bonners Ferry grew from the site of a ferry crossing on the Kootenay River in northern Idaho. Edwin Bonner established the ferry to transport people taking the Wildhorse Trail northwest to the mines of British Columbia after gold was discovered there in the early 1860s. A small community grew up around the ferry and prospered as a supply center for the mines to the north. Construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad, a transcontinental line that eventually ran from Minnesota to the Pacific Northwest, began in 1870. The line reached what is now Bonner County in 1881. In 1893, the transcontinental line from Seattle to Minneapolis-St. Paul was completed, including a station in Bonners Ferry. A subsidiary of Great Northern built a rail line from Bonners Ferry to the Canadian border in 1898. As Bonners Ferry developed in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the impact of farming and logging on the local economy grew.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Kootenai Herald</em> was founded in 1891. Edited and Published by Stephen D. Taylor, the <em>Herald</em> was headquartered in the town of Kootenai on the north shore of Lake Pend Oreille for its first six months of publication. In 1892, The <em>Herald</em> moved north to the town of Bonners Ferry along the banks of the Kootenay River. The weekly eight-page, five-column paper published on Saturdays and covered news from the communities of Sand Point, Eaton, Eatonville, Fry, Bonners Ferry, and Hope. The <em>Herald</em> covered the development and construction of the Great Northern Railway through Idaho&#8217;s panhandle, as well as the Coeur d&#8217;Alene mining wars. The paper also chronicled anti-Chinese sentiment in Idaho and the U.S., including the Chinese Exclusion Act and the forced expulsion of Chinese workers from Bonners Ferry in 1892.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the farming and lumber industries sustained the community. The <em>Kootenai Herald</em> published in Bonners Ferry until 1904, when the editor changed the newspaper&#8217;s name to the <em>Bonners Ferry Herald</em>. The paper&#8217;s original editor, Stephen D. Taylor, edited the <em>Herald</em> until 1911, when Bert Hall took over as editor for a short time. In 1912 Charles W. King became the <em>Herald&#8217;s</em> editor. King sold the <em>Herald</em> in the 1950s. The <em>Bonners Ferry Herald</em> continues to publish to this day.</p>',\n",

Each Saturday, the four-page paper was published with a quotation on the masthead by Thomas Jefferson: &#8220;Error ceases to be dangerous, when reason is left free to combat it.&#8221; The paper was Whig in its politics and highly supportive of William Henry Harrison&#8217;s election in 1841. Early in the publication, the editor was Cyril C. Cady, but after September 12, 1840, the publishers are listed as James R. Benson and Clark H. Green. Printed in Fayette until 1848, it was the last Whig paper to be published in town.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1848, the paper moved from Fayette to Glasgow, Missouri, where it became known as the <a href=\"/item/sn86063325/\"><em>Glasgow Weekly Times</em></a> and ran until the start of the Civil War in 1861. Clark H. Green and Paul Shirley began publishing the paper, but in January of 1849, Green was the sole editor and proprietor. Until 1861, the Thomas Jefferson quotation appeared on the masthead just as it had done on the <em>Boon&#8217;s Lick Times</em>. However, in 1861, the masthead was changed to read: &#8220;Devoted to political, agricultural and general intelligence.&#8221; The paper was popular but ran into hardship when war broke out. The final issue states that publication of the full-sized newspaper would be suspended due to &#8220;a general depression in business, the impossibility of making collections, and the fact that but little is doing of which money can be realized.&#8221; Green had plans to continue publishing in a small sheet format which would include legal notices and advertisements alongside a brief summary of important state news, but there is no record of any of these sheets being published.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter the Civil War ended, the newspaper business picked back up in Glasgow. Francis M. Taylor began printing the<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> </span></span><a href=\"/item/sn89066162/\"><em>Howard Union</em></a> on a weekly basis. The paper supported state and national organizations who were working to &#8220;wipe out the last traces of the rebellion, restore the union of the States, and secure the return once more of peace and prosperity to the people.&#8221; Published every Thursday, the <em>Howard Union</em> was a four-page paper, and like the preceding titles, Taylor chose to print Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s words on the masthead.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTaylor stopped publishing in 1866, and James B. Thompson began printing the <a href=\"/item/sn89066163/\"><em>Glasgow Weekly Times</em></a>, which ran from 1866 to 1869. The paper was politically conservative and promised to support &#8220;the overthrow of the red-handed dynasty that is trampling upon the rights of the people of this State, and the repeal of that nameless abomination, miscalled the Constitution.&#8221; On August 24, 1866, James B. Thompson sold the paper to his brother, William A. Thompson. The available collection of this paper is small, with only four issues: three in 1866 and one in 1869, beginning with the announcement that William Thompson had become the proprietor.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Bossier Banner</em> was a four-page weekly newspaper founded in Bellevue, Louisiana, in 1859 by William Henry Scanland (1842-1916). Born in Mississippi and orphaned at a young age, Scanland, along with his brother John, went to work for the <a href=\"/item/sn83016488\"><em>Caddo Gazette</em></a> in Shreveport, Louisiana, at the age of 11. In 1858, the Scanland brothers briefly published the <em>Caddo Gazette, Junior</em>, in their free time.

Many issues consisted heavily of advertisements and announcements of tax sales. The paper frequently carried religious stories and scripture, as well as sermons by Thomas De Witt Talmage, a popular late 19th-century American preacher. The discovery of oil in north Louisiana in 1908 and Bossier Parish&#8217;s subsequent transition from a cotton- to petroleum-based economy initially received little attention; the <em>Banner</em> did, however, carry the charters of local oil companies. The local Good Roads movement of the early 20th century was covered in some detail.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe September 27, 1900 issue of the <em>Bossier Banner</em> was a special souvenir edition, published as <em>The Free State of Bossier</em>.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tBottineau County lies in the middle and northernmost region of North Dakota. To the north, it shares borders with both Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and its history is strongly connected to its northern neighbor. The county, as well as its county seat, is named for Pierre Bottineau. Born in Manitoba in 1817, Bottineau was a renowned buffalo hunter, diplomat, translator, and trusted regional guide. He was of French-Canadian, Sioux, and Chippewa descent, reflecting the heritage and history of Souris River valley. From the early 1700s, the region drew French and British colonists, coming to make a living as fur traders and trappers.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBottineau County was constituted on January 4, 1883, six years before North Dakota&#8217;s statehood. In 1884, the nearest railroad to Bottineau was 120 miles away in Creel City (later Devils Lake). A stage coach, running every Monday and Thursday, was the only means of travel to the city until 1887, when the Great Northern Railroad arrived. The county&#8217;s foremost industries were wheat farming and sheep and cattle ranching, which remain important today. Bottineau County also boasts the beautiful Turtle Mountains and Lake Metigoshe, which are important tourist attraction during the summer and winter months.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe county&#8217;s first newspaper, the <em>Bottineau Pioneer</em>, appeared in the fall of 1885, with William Bickman as editor. With quick turnover in the burgeoning pioneer town of Bottineau, John W. Bennett replaced Bickman a year later. In 1894, Charles S. McCandless became editor of the <em>Pioneer</em> when it consolidated with the <em>Bottineau Freelance</em>, which ran from 1887 to 1893. The <em>Pioneer</em> was politically a Democratic leaning publication, while the <em>Freelance</em> had been Republican.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tBottineau County lies in the middle and northernmost region of North Dakota. To the north, it shares borders with both Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and its history is strongly connected to its northern neighbor. The county, as well as its county seat, is named for Pierre Bottineau. Born in Manitoba in 1817, Bottineau was a renowned buffalo hunter, diplomat, translator, and trusted regional guide. He was of French-Canadian, Sioux, and Chippewa descent, reflecting the heritage and history of Souris River valley. From the early 1700s, the region drew French and British colonists, coming to make a living as fur traders and trappers.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBottineau County was constituted on January 4, 1883, six years before North Dakota&#8217;s statehood. In 1884, the nearest railroad to Bottineau was 120 miles away in Creel City (later Devils Lake). A stage coach, running every Monday and Thursday, was the only means of travel to the city until 1887, when the Great Northern Railroad arrived. The county&#8217;s foremost industries were wheat farming and sheep and cattle ranching, which remain important today. Bottineau County also boasts the beautiful Turtle Mountains and Lake Metigoshe, which are important tourist attraction during the summer and winter months.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe county&#8217;s first newspaper, the <em>Bottineau Pioneer</em>, appeared in the fall of 1885, with William Bickman as editor. With quick turnover in the burgeoning pioneer town of Bottineau, John W. Bennett replaced Bickman a year later. In 1894, Charles S. McCandless became editor of the <em>Pioneer</em> when it consolidated with the <em>Bottineau Freelance</em>, which ran from 1887 to 1893. The <em>Pioneer</em> was politically a Democratic leaning publication, while the <em>Freelance</em> had been Republican. After merging the two papers, McCandless decided that the newly consolidated <em>Pioneer</em> would be politically Independent. This was an unusual choice, illustrated by the reactions of other local newspapers. The <em>Turtle Mountains Times</em> &#8220;congratulate[d] McCandless in his new orb of politics and field of loneliness,&#8221; and the <a href=\"/item/sn88076613\"><em>North Dakota Eagle</em></a> observed that &#8221; Mac. has always been a little off color and we may prepare to expect almost anything.&#8221; In May of 1895, the <em>Pioneer</em> changed editors once again, as well as its name, becoming the<em>Bottineau Courant</em>.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Bozeman Courier</em> began life as the <em>Bozeman Avant Courier</em> in 1872, only eight years after the city of Bozeman was established. Like the town itself, the newspaper saw many changes. In 1882, the publication became the <em>Weekly Avant Courier</em>. This name would only last until 1889, when the paper reached slightly into its past for its next name: the <em>Avant Courier</em>. In 1905, the <em>Avant Courier</em> merged with the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86075117\"><em>Gallatin County Republican</em></a> to become the <em>Republican Courier</em>. From 1913 to 1919, the paper was known as the <em>Weekly Courier</em>. The final name change occurred in 1919 when the paper became the <em>Bozeman Courier</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEditorship of the <em>Courier</em> changed less frequently than its name, but not by much. Between 1922 and 1927, the <em>Courier</em> had three editors. S.C. Moore was editor in 1922 and presumably 1923, though no editor was listed for that year. F.W. Egleston became managing editor in 1924 and handed that role to W.W. Casper the next year.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAside from news of the town, the paper covered agriculture news and events at Montana State College (later Montana State University). For example, the June 4, 1924 issue contains headlines ranging from &#8220;Montana State College Graduates Largest Class, Saturday June 7&#8221; to &#8220;Foot and Mouth Disease Spreads.&#8221; A section dedicated to state livestock news appeared in every issue, and the occasional opening of a new building on the college campus was covered. Reports of football games between the Montana State College Bobcats and the University of Montana Grizzlies documented the earlier stages of the schools&#8217; long rivalry. News of prominent Bozeman residents Nelson and Ellen Story also appeared, including stories on their respective deaths.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlthough &#8220;Republican&#8221; was only part of the paper&#8217;s name for a short time, the publication&#8217;s political affiliation rarely wavered. Occasionally, the paper was more than clear on its position, as in this editorial also from June 4, 1924:</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t&#8220;Without doubt the most disgusting show of extreme Democratic partisanship that has so far reared its cobra head in this community was the recent veiled attack on President Calvin Coolidge, in which a weak and self-contradictory attempt was made to draw the former vice president into the Tea Pot Dome oil scandal.&#8221;</p>',\n",

Before moving to Bozeman, Yerkes had operated the <a href=\"/item/sn86075022\"><em>Yellowstone Journal</em></a> in Miles City.&#160; During the War of the Copper Kings in the 1890s, industrialist Marcus Daly purchased the <a href=\"/item/sn86075107\"><em>Bozeman Chronicle</em></a>, the successor to the <em>Bozeman Weekly Chronicle</em>, for $11,000.&#160; When the <em>Chronicle</em> became a daily in 1911, it was the smallest city newspaper to offer a full report of the Associated Press.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tReaders in eastern Orange County, Vermont and northwestern Grafton County, New Hampshire have been served by the weekly <em>Opinion</em> since 1865. Araunah A. Earle, who had been responsible for the <a href=\"/item/sn84022548/\"><em>Orleans Independent Standard</em></a> in northern Vermont, started the <em>National Opinion</em> in Bradford in 1865, but by October 1866 he had repurchased the <em>Standard</em> and returned to Barton. His editor and business partner, David W. Cobb, purchased the paper and published it until 1874, joined briefly by William H. H. Earle. In 1874, the Bradford Publishing Company hired Ben F. Stanton as publisher and editor. He changed the paper&#8217;s name to the <em>Bradford Opinion</em>. Unrecorded difficulties, most likely financial, led to the simultaneous publication of competing weeklies from 1879 to 1881. The Orange County Publishing Company maintained the <em>Bradford Opinion</em>, while Stanton countered with <a href=\"/item/sn91063293/\"><em>Stanton&#8217;s Bradford Opinion</em></a>.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe acrimonious rivalry ended in November 1881 when Harry E. Parker acquired both papers. Parker continued the weekly as the <em>United Opinion</em> and also issued a daily. Only two issues of the <a href=\"/item/sn99067885/\"><em>Daily Opinion</em></a> survive, but it appears to have been published from at least 1881 through December 1884. Parker was involved with the <em>Opinion</em> for 47 years. His daughter, Sara K. Parker, was listed on the masthead as associate editor from 1909 to 1924 and later as the president of the Opinion Publishing Company. In 1916, a national trade journal mentioned that she was one of only two women editors in Vermont. For many years, the Parker family spent the winter in Florida, and Harry Parker shared enthusiastic descriptions of Miami&#8217;s booming development and his Florida business ventures, social activities, and travels in a weekly &#8220;Letter from the Southland.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStephen M. Kelley purchased the <em>Opinion</em> in 1929 and sold it six years later to J. Glen Sault, whose wife and son joined him in the operation. Gardner Boyd took over in the summer of 1947, but his tenure was cut short by a disastrous fire in December 1947. Following the fire, John Drysdale published the <em>Opinion</em> in conjunction with the <a href=\"/item/sn95068667/\"><em>White River Valley Herald</em></a> until 1970, when it was sold and consolidated with the <a href=\"/item/sn91063291/\"><em>North Country Journal</em></a>, a Woodsville, New Hampshire paper. During the next eight years, the paper was issued under three titles, including the <a href=\"/item/sn91063292/\"><em>North Country Journal Opinion</em></a>, the <a href=\"/item/sn91063294/\"><em>Journal-Opinion</em></a>, and the <a href=\"/item/sn91063296/\"><em>United Opinion</em></a>, before the publishers settled on the <a href=\"/item/sn83008634/\"><em>Journal-Opinion</em></a>, the name still on the masthead in 2014.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSince 1867, when D.W. Cobb promised to &#8220;secure all items of local interest,&#8221; the <em>Opinion&#8217;s</em>publishers and editors have been committed to producing a strong local paper. In the 21st century, the paper continues to provide &#8220;good, local news&#8221; to more than 10,000 readers each week. One notable local topic that the <em>Opinion</em> has covered during its long run is copper mining, an important part of the Orange County economy from 1809 to 1958. The paper includes articles about mine operations, investors, and workers, as well as about more recent efforts to mitigate environmental pollution and preserve an important historic landscape.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> in 1844. Its competitor, the <em>Abbeville Independent Press </em>(later known as the <em>Abbeville Press</em>) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the <em>Abbeville Independent Press</em>, Puckett having previously edited the <a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"><em>Anderson Southern Rights</em> <em>Advocate</em></a> and Fant having apprenticed with the <a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"><em>Anderson Gazette</em></a>. During the Civil War, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and merged it with the <em>Abbeville Press</em> to create the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the <em>Press and Banner</em> steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &#8220;Bourbons,&#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"><em>Abbeville Medium</em></a>, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the <em>Press and Banner</em> generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the <em>Independent Press</em>, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the <em>Press and Banner</em>, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the <a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"><em>Press and Banner</em></a>.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <cite>Adair County News</cite> covered south-central Kentucky&#8217;s eastern Pennyrile region, but its appeal extended beyond the small county seat of Columbia. In 1909, subscriptions included advertisements for businesses in Columbia and nearby towns, including Lebanon, Russell Springs, Greensburg, and Jamestown. Charles S. Harris established the <cite>Adair County News</cite> in 1887 as a Democratic counter to Alvin A. Strange&#8217;s Republican <a href=\"/item/sn84027426/\"><cite>Columbia Spectator</cite></a>, with hopes, according to the first issue, that it would be a true Democratic paper, come to advocate honest convictions and defend noble principles.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTurn-of-the-century Columbia was an isolated community. In 1910, local farmers and businessmen still traveled almost 20 miles to Campbellsville, Kentucky to receive goods or ship their products on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad. Unsurprisingly, the prospect of a railroad connection to Columbia was newsworthy, although it was a prospect that never materialized. The <cite>Adair County News</cite> included reports of Columbia and Louisville agricultural markets, social news, and correspondence from nearby towns. (A Gradyville, Kentucky, correspondent declared in the paper&#8217;s first issue: The election excitement has quieted and everybody has gone to business.) <cite>Adair County News</cite> also chronicled pivotal events in Columbia&#8217;s history, including the founding of the Lindsey Wilson Training School in 1903, later to become Lindsey Wilson College. In 1919, Judge Rollin T. Hurt, writing under the pseudonym John Avroe Steel, began a lengthy series of columns on Adair County&#8217;s early history.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhile Charles Harris handled the paper&#8217;s finances, John Edward Murrell (1849-1926) was its voice for many years. Murrell had worked for several weekly community newspapers, including the <cite>Columbia Spectator</cite>, before joining Harris to found the <cite>News</cite>. Murrell proudly presented original content, providing editorial and news notes for each issue during his tenure at the paper. Murrell also frequently commented on national events, and he was a caustic critic of President Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s appointment of African Americans to federal positions in the South or of any other challenge to the prevailing racial order.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1917, Harris sold the <cite>Adair County News</cite> to Barksdale Hamlett, who had served as Kentucky&#8217;s superintendent of public instruction from 1912 to 1916. Daisy Hamlett would become publisher after her husband&#8217;s death in 1919. In 1926, her son, Edward, succeeded Murrell as the paper&#8217;s editor. Mary L. Smith, known affectionately as Mamie, who had begun her career with the paper in 1909, worked alongside Edward Hamlett as compositor, bookkeeper, and office manager until her death in 1954. Mamie Smith also contributed to the paper&#8217;s personal notes and local coverage. The <cite>Adair County News</cite>, the county&#8217;s most durable newspaper, continued until 1987, when in the span of four successive years it was replaced by a number of other weeklies, including the <a href=\"/item/sn87060313/\"><cite>Columbia-Adair County News-Statesman</cite></a>, the <a href=\"/item/sn89058422/\"><cite>Adair County News-Statesman</cite></a>, the <a href=\"/item/sn89058421/\"><cite>Columbia Newsweek</cite></a>, and the <a href=\"/item/sn90004625/\"><cite>Columbia News</cite></a>.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tFor nearly a century, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> (1844-1925) reported on international, national, and local news for the citizens of Abbeville County, located in the upstate region of South Carolina. The <em>N.W. Ayer &amp; Son&#8217;s American Newspaper Annual</em> described Abbeville County simply as a &#8220;cotton growing district,&#8221; which while true on the surface is also slightly misleading. Although the cultivation of cotton had indeed dominated the county&#8217;s economy for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in the 1890s Abbeville was undergoing a period of economic growth, starting with the arrival of the Georgia, Carolina, and Northern Railroad (later called the Seaboard Air Line) in 1892 and the founding of the Abbeville Cotton Mill Company in 1895. Other significant developments in the region included: the establishment of an African American school, called Ferguson Academy (later renamed Harbison Agricultural College), in 1868; the founding of Calhoun Falls at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and Savannah Valley Railroad in the early 1890s; and the creation of Greenwood and McCormick Counties from portions of Abbeville County in 1899 and 1916.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> began as two weekly newspapers, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and <em>Abbeville Press</em>. Charles Henry Allen and Henry S. Kerr had established the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> in 1844. Its competitor, the <em>Abbeville Independent Press </em>(later known as the <em>Abbeville Press</em>) began in 1853. Coleman C. Puckett and George W. Fant brought considerable experience to their jobs as publishers of the <em>Abbeville Independent Press</em>, Puckett having previously edited the <a href=\"/item/sn85026942/\"><em>Anderson Southern Rights</em> <em>Advocate</em></a> and Fant having apprenticed with the <a href=\"/item/sn85042528/\"><em>Anderson Gazette</em></a>. During the Civil War, the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> suspended publication. Hugh Wilson, Jr. and William Augustus Lee, the proprietors of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>, turned over publishing duties to a former business partner and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Sadly, few issues of either newspaper have survived from the 1860s.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter the war, Wilson and Lee bought the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> and merged it with the <em>Abbeville Press</em> to create the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1869. Like other white Democrat newspapers of the era, the <em>Press and Banner</em> steered a conservative course, celebrating the return of the &#8220;Bourbons,&#8221; or antebellum-era aristocrats, to political power in 1877 and championing the interests of agrarian elites. Throughout its existence, it faced only one true competitor, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"><em>Abbeville Medium</em></a>, which existed from 1871 through 1923. Circulation rates for the <em>Press and Banner</em> generally hovered between 800 and 1,200 subscriptions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSeveral of the men who ran these newspapers were leaders in their communities. George W. Fant, who was briefly involved with the <em>Independent Press</em>, served as postmaster and director of the National Bank of Anderson. Hugh Wilson, Jr., in addition to editing and publishing the <em>Press and Banner</em>, served as director of and stockholder in the Abbeville Cotton Mill and was also an officer in the South Carolina Press Association. Fellow proprietor William Augustus Lee practiced real estate law, represented the Abbeville District in the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1865, and served as a state representative in 1865-66.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStarting in the 1920s, the <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> underwent a series of changes, from adopting a triweekly publication schedule to shortening its name to the <a href=\"/item/2013228796/\"><em>Press and Banner</em></a>. In 1925, the newspaper merged with the <a href=\"/item/sn93067666/\"><em>Abbeville Evening Medium</em></a> and became the <a href=\"/item/sn86063799/\"><em>Press and Banner and Abbeville Medium</em></a>. The paper continues to this day as a family-owned operation, having been edited and published by three generations of the family of its founder Fred Devereaux West, Sr.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Illinois Staats-Zeitung</em> (ISZ) was a German-language immigrant newspaper that existed in various formats from 1848-1922. At first a weekly paper, it added a daily run (except Sunday) beginning in 1851, and it published a daily evening edition, the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045003/\"><em>Abendblatt der Illinois Staats-zeitung</em></a> 1891-1894 and <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045004/\"><em>Abendblatt</em></a> from 1894-1899. The paper was founded by Forty-Eighters: progressive revolutionaries who were forced to flee Germany and seek refuge elsewhere&#8212;including Chicago, where they quickly became the largest ethnic group. Forty-Eighters such as Editor Georg Schneider brought modern values to the paper, arguing against slavery, anti-immigrant discrimination, and liquor regulations. When the Republican Party was formed in 1854, the <em>ISZ</em> became a firm supporter, and &#8220;the leading Republican paper of the Northwest.&#8221; Even though most German immigrants at the time were Democrats, the <em>ISZ</em> grew rapidly, and within a decade, it became the biggest German-language paper west of New York.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnton C. Hesing bought the paper in 1867. He brought Hermann Raster, a well-known correspondent from the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87067019/\"><em>New Yorker Abend-Zeitung</em></a>, aboard as editor, and the two of them began an effort to use the <em>ISZ</em> to convince German Americans to support Republicans. The pair became major players in the Illinois Republican Party, especially Hesing, who acted as the political boss for Chicago Germans from the 1860s to 1875. The first German to hold elected office in Illinois, Hesing leveraged his power to put Germans in city and county offices, combat nativism, and push Republicans towards repealing liquor laws. Alcohol control was an especially strong point of contention: in 1872, Hesing and Raster forced the Republican Party to adopt an anti-Prohibition platform if they wanted the German vote. The resulting declaration of the &#8220;right to drink what one pleases&#8221; became known as the Raster resolution.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThough the <em>ISZ</em>&#8216;s political influence declined after the 1870s, it enjoyed steady growth throughout the end of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth. The paper reached its peak circulation in 1915, publishing 50,000 papers a day. Unfortunately, World War I and the resulting anti-German sentiment sent the <em>ISZ</em> into a massive downward spiral: within three years, the paper lost 10,000 subscribers and most of its advertisers. Part of this was due to the <em>ISZ</em> favoring Germany in the war; former president Theodore Roosevelt attacked it as &#8220;German propaganda.&#8221; Though the paper rebuked this statement and later supported the United States, the financial damage was done, and the Staats-Zeitung Corporation suspended business in June 1918. In October, the <em>ISZ</em> was sold, and daily publication resumed for &#8220;government purposes&#8221; of reaching citizens who only spoke German. This revival was short-lived: from March to November 1921, it was suspended again and sold. That December, it had its final death-knell when Editor Arthur Lorenz wrote an article harshly criticizing the American Legion, an association of WWI veterans. Fewer than ten days later, he was arrested, charged with libel, and recommended for deportation. This was more than the ailing paper could stand. In 1922, the <em>ISZ</em> finally folded and was incorporated into the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045558/\"><em>Deutsch-Amerikanische B&#252;rger-Zeitung</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <cite>Abilene Reflector</cite>, founded in the latter half of 1883, was an eight-page newspaper published every Thursday. Abilene is the county seat for Dickinson County, and by the early 1880s it had shed its rough cowtown image of the late 1860s to become a thriving commercial center with a rapidly growing population. By 1884 the town boasted a new public water system, an opera house seating nearly 1,000 persons, a telephone exchange, several banks, and three newspapers, including the <cite>Reflector</cite>. In March 1888, the <cite>Reflector</cite> became the official paper of Dickinson County, seizing the title from the <a href=\"/item/sn84029420/\"><cite>Abilene Gazette</cite></a>. The <cite>Reflector</cite> retained this status throughout its tenure. In its own words, the paper was &#8220;conducted in the interest of the Democratic party, believing the party in its wisdom in the choice of candidates, from county offices to national, is greater than personal feeling or prejudice.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe founding editors of the <cite>Reflector</cite> were brothers Berzelius L. Strother and Sidonia K. Strother. In June 1885, S.K. Strother left to join the <a href=\"/item/sn90061444/\"><cite>Kansas City Times</cite></a>. Henry Litts took over his half of ownership and assumed full editorial responsibilities in March 1887 when B.L. Strother retired from the newspaper for health reasons.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn February 23, 1888, the <cite>Reflector</cite> was purchased by the Reflector Publishing Company consisting of John J. Cooper as president and Richard Waring as business manager. With them, the <cite>Reflector</cite> began a new Republican Party affiliation. Henry Litts left the paper &#8220;regretful because it will reflect Republican and not Democratic doctrine.&#8221; The new proprietors cited &#8220;the universal demand of republicans in this section of the state for a Republican newspaper at Abilene&#8221; and began the &#8220;anomalous task of converting a Simon-pure democratic paper into a live, progressive republican journal.&#8221; Later that same year, the Strother brothers established a Democratic newspaper in Abilene called the <a href=\"/item/sn84029375/\"><cite>Dickinson County News</cite></a> which claimed to have &#8220;a larger circulation than any other weekly in the county.&#8221; In fact, the two papers were evenly matched. In 1890, the Republican <cite>Reflector</cite> circulated only 25 more copies than the Democratic <cite>News</cite>; in 1893, the <cite>News</cite> circulated 87 more issues than its rival.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <cite>Reflector</cite> had also appeared in a daily edition, the <a href=\"/item/sn84029377/\"><cite>Evening Reflector</cite></a>, beginning May 9, 1887. Within a few months of the purchase of the paper in 1888, both editions changed title: the weekly <cite>Abilene Reflector</cite> became the <a href=\"/item/sn84029386/\"><cite>Abilene Weekly Reflector</cite></a> beginning on May 3, and the daily <cite>Evening Reflector</cite> became the <a href=\"/item/sn84029378/\"><cite>Abilene Daily Reflector</cite></a> beginning on May 2. The daily edition absorbed the weekly edition in 1935 and then in 1942 merged with the <a href=\"/item/sn84029366/\"><cite>Abilene Daily Chronicle</cite></a> to become the <a href=\"/item/sn84029353/\"><cite>Abilene Reflector-Chronicle</cite></a>, which continues today.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tSouth Dakota&#8217;s <em>Aberdeen Democrat</em> was a weekly paper originally published by George B. Daly. The first issue was published on Friday, December 23, 1887, in Aberdeen&#8217;s Pioneer Building. The paper had six columns, with its page length varying between two and eight pages. For a brief time, the <em>Democrat</em> was published on Wednesdays, before returning to Friday publication in November of 1902. The final issue was published on Friday, April 19, 1909, after which the title was changed to the <a href=\"/item/sn98069050/\"><em>Dakota Democrat</em></a>.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Aberdeen Democrat</em> was originally titled the <em>Aberdeen Pioneer</em> and owned by D.C. Wadsworth in 1881. Less than a year later, the title was changed to the <em><a href=\"/item/sn2001063589/\">Aberdeen Republican</a></em> to avoid confusion with another area paper, the <a href=\"/item/sn96064286/\"><em>Dakota Pioneer</em></a>. After changing hands many times, the paper finally was bought by George B. Daly in 1898, who changed its title to the<em> Aberdeen Democrat</em>. Even though Daly owned the paper, the first publishers were C.C. Fetcher and Searle. Daly took over as editor sometime between August 17, 1900, and October 22, 1902. On October 20, 1906, Daly sold the <em>Aberdeen Democrat</em> to George P. Willmarth, who would later rename the paper the <em>Dakota Democrat</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe main audience of the <em>Aberdeen Democrat</em> was not just residents of the city of Aberdeen alone, but people throughout Brown County, both farmers and businessmen. Regular features included a Railroad Directory, Weekly Market Report, as well as a foreign news section. Many of the <em>Democrat&#8217;s</em> editors were vocal about their political opinions, especially when opposing Republicans in office. On April 8, 1904, for example, Daly wrote, &#8220;it is sincerely to be hoped that the active element in city politics who control the Republican caucuses and through them the Republican party, and by it the city, may be gracious enough this year to give the good people of Aberdeen a far better administration of city affairs than their civic patriotism, too week [sic] as a rule to rise above party, entitles them to.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Democrat</em> had many competitors and was often badgered by the other Aberdeen papers. Eight years after it was renamed the <em>Dakota Democrat</em>, the paper moved to Mobridge, South Dakota, where it continued in print until 1921.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tMonroe County was created in 1821 from ancestral Chickasaw lands on the Alabama border in northeast Mississippi. The terrain varied from fertile black prairie suitable for growing cotton in the west to the heavily timbered red hills and sandy, clay soils in the east. Established by a Scotsman as a trading post on the navigable Tombigbee River, Aberdeen was incorporated in 1837 and became the county seat in 1849. By 1910, Aberdeen had around 5,000 inhabitants and was an important regional manufacturing and commercial center.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMonroe County had a newspaper supporting the Democratic Party almost continuously since 1842, with the launch of the four-page, weekly <em>Mississippi Advertiser</em> (1842-48), also known as the <em>Advertiser</em>. A series of talented and occasionally related newspapermen moved from one publication to another; <em>Advertiser</em> publishers William E. Smith and William D. Chapman published the succeeding <a href=\"/item/sn83016869/\"><em>Monroe Democrat</em> (1848-52)</a>. When the next Democratic organ, the <em>Sunny South</em> (1856-66?), ended, Sidney Alroy Jonas and another former employee started the long-running <em>Aberdeen Examiner</em> (1866-2008), also called the <em>Weekly Aberdeen Examiner</em>. The <em>Examiner, </em>which also had a tri-weekly edition, eventually absorbed the successor to the <em>Aberdeen Weekly</em> (1878-1933). The <em>Weekly</em>&#8216;s long-time publisher/editor, Thomas Tuley Deavenport, was the nephew of Dr. Matthew Deavenport, who had published the <em>Monroe Democrat</em> towards the end of its run. The <em>Examiner</em> and the <em>Weekly</em>, also published as the <em>Weekly Ledger</em>, both began with a four-page format and were expanded to eight pages at some point in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe antebellum Aberdeen newspapers focused on national politics as described in the <em>Mississippi Advertiser</em>&#8216;s prospectus.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe short-lived weekly <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em> (July-August 1865) offers a glimpse into a community adapting to new realities under challenging circumstances. In the early 1860s, the white citizens of Abbeville County (then Abbeville District), South Carolina, had enthusiastically rallied in support of the secessionist cause. During the Civil War, they paid a heavy price. At least 349 out of a total of 11,516 white men in Abbeville were killed in combat (the numbers of those who were injured or who died due to inadequate medical treatments were undoubtedly much higher).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen Hugh Wilson established the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, the leading weekly newspapers the <a href=\"/item/sn85042527/\"><em>Abbeville Press</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn85026945/\"><em>Abbeville Banner</em></a> had both suspended publication, leaving a gap in news reporting in the community. Wilson relied extensively on other South Carolina newspapers including the <a href=\"/item/sn84027008/\"><em>Columbia Daily Phoenix</em></a>, <a href=\"/item/sn93030285/\"><em>Greenville Patriot and Mountaineer</em></a>, and <a href=\"/item/2012218730/\"><em>Newberry Weekly Herald</em></a> for news items. He published only six issues of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, four of which have survived.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEvidence of the end of the Civil War permeated the pages of the <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>. The August 10, 1865 issue carried general orders from the U.S. military provisional government and a proclamation by South Carolina&#8217;s provisional governor James L. Orr. The August 25, 1865 issue contained reports on taxes levied by military authorities on bakeries, dry goods dealers, restaurants, and saloons in Charleston. It also included a table of values in gold for Confederate notes, a reminder that the former Confederate states had suffered an economic as well as a military loss.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn August 31, 1865, Hugh Wilson announced that he and his business partner William Augustus Lee were resuming publication of the <em>Abbeville Press</em>. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em> was to be immediately discontinued. Wilson and Lee would later combine the <em>Abbeville Press</em> with the <em>Abbeville Banner</em> to create the <a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"><em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em></a>, which has continued through several title changes into the present. The <em>Abbeville Bulletin</em>, by contrast, remains an interesting footnote in the history of newspaper publishing in Abbeville.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <cite>Abilene Reflector</cite>, founded in the latter half of 1883, was an eight-page newspaper published every Thursday. Abilene is the county seat for Dickinson County, and by the early 1880s it had shed its rough cowtown image of the late 1860s to become a thriving commercial center with a rapidly growing population. By 1884 the town boasted a new public water system, an opera house seating nearly 1,000 persons, a telephone exchange, several banks, and three newspapers, including the <cite>Reflector</cite>. In March 1888, the <cite>Reflector</cite> became the official paper of Dickinson County, seizing the title from the <a href=\"/item/sn84029420/\"><cite>Abilene Gazette</cite></a>. The <cite>Reflector</cite> retained this status throughout its tenure. In its own words, the paper was &#8220;conducted in the interest of the Democratic party, believing the party in its wisdom in the choice of candidates, from county offices to national, is greater than personal feeling or prejudice.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe founding editors of the <cite>Reflector</cite> were brothers Berzelius L. Strother and Sidonia K. Strother. In June 1885, S.K. Strother left to join the <a href=\"/item/sn90061444/\"><cite>Kansas City Times</cite></a>. Henry Litts took over his half of ownership and assumed full editorial responsibilities in March 1887 when B.L. Strother retired from the newspaper for health reasons.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn February 23, 1888, the <cite>Reflector</cite> was purchased by the Reflector Publishing Company consisting of John J. Cooper as president and Richard Waring as business manager. With them, the <cite>Reflector</cite> began a new Republican Party affiliation. Henry Litts left the paper &#8220;regretful because it will reflect Republican and not Democratic doctrine.&#8221; The new proprietors cited &#8220;the universal demand of republicans in this section of the state for a Republican newspaper at Abilene&#8221; and began the &#8220;anomalous task of converting a Simon-pure democratic paper into a live, progressive republican journal.&#8221; Later that same year, the Strother brothers established a Democratic newspaper in Abilene called the <a href=\"/item/sn84029375/\"><cite>Dickinson County News</cite></a> which claimed to have &#8220;a larger circulation than any other weekly in the county.&#8221; In fact, the two papers were evenly matched. In 1890, the Republican <cite>Reflector</cite> circulated only 25 more copies than the Democratic <cite>News</cite>; in 1893, the <cite>News</cite> circulated 87 more issues than its rival.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <cite>Reflector</cite> had also appeared in a daily edition, the <a href=\"/item/sn84029377/\"><cite>Evening Reflector</cite></a>, beginning May 9, 1887. Within a few months of the purchase of the paper in 1888, both editions changed title: the weekly <cite>Abilene Reflector</cite> became the <a href=\"/item/sn84029386/\"><cite>Abilene Weekly Reflector</cite></a> beginning on May 3, and the daily <cite>Evening Reflector</cite> became the <a href=\"/item/sn84029378/\"><cite>Abilene Daily Reflector</cite></a> beginning on May 2. The daily edition absorbed the weekly edition in 1935 and then in 1942 merged with the <a href=\"/item/sn84029366/\"><cite>Abilene Daily Chronicle</cite></a> to become the <a href=\"/item/sn84029353/\"><cite>Abilene Reflector-Chronicle</cite></a>, which continues today.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tMonroe County was created in 1821 from ancestral Chickasaw lands on the Alabama border in northeast Mississippi. The terrain varied from fertile black prairie suitable for growing cotton in the west to the heavily timbered red hills and sandy, clay soils in the east. Established by a Scotsman as a trading post on the navigable Tombigbee River, Aberdeen was incorporated in 1837 and became the county seat in 1849. By 1910, Aberdeen had around 5,000 inhabitants and was an important regional manufacturing and commercial center.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMonroe County had a newspaper supporting the Democratic Party almost continuously since 1842, with the launch of the four-page, weekly <em>Mississippi Advertiser</em> (1842-48), also known as the <em>Advertiser</em>. A series of talented and occasionally related newspapermen moved from one publication to another; <em>Advertiser</em> publishers William E. Smith and William D. Chapman published the succeeding <a href=\"/item/sn83016869/\"><em>Monroe Democrat</em> (1848-52)</a>. When the next Democratic organ, the <em>Sunny South</em> (1856-66?), ended, Sidney Alroy Jonas and another former employee started the long-running <em>Aberdeen Examiner</em> (1866-2008), also called the <em>Weekly Aberdeen Examiner</em>. The <em>Examiner, </em>which also had a tri-weekly edition, eventually absorbed the successor to the <em>Aberdeen Weekly</em> (1878-1933). The <em>Weekly</em>&#8216;s long-time publisher/editor, Thomas Tuley Deavenport, was the nephew of Dr. Matthew Deavenport, who had published the <em>Monroe Democrat</em> towards the end of its run. The <em>Examiner</em> and the <em>Weekly</em>, also published as the <em>Weekly Ledger</em>, both began with a four-page format and were expanded to eight pages at some point in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe antebellum Aberdeen newspapers focused on national politics as described in the <em>Mississippi Advertiser</em>&#8216;s prospectus.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Illinois Staats-Zeitung</em> (ISZ) was a German-language immigrant newspaper that existed in various formats from 1848-1922. At first a weekly paper, it added a daily run (except Sunday) beginning in 1851, and it published a daily evening edition, the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045003/\"><em>Abendblatt der Illinois Staats-zeitung</em></a> 1891-1894 and <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045004/\"><em>Abendblatt</em></a> from 1894-1899. The paper was founded by Forty-Eighters: progressive revolutionaries who were forced to flee Germany and seek refuge elsewhere&#8212;including Chicago, where they quickly became the largest ethnic group. Forty-Eighters such as Editor Georg Schneider brought modern values to the paper, arguing against slavery, anti-immigrant discrimination, and liquor regulations. When the Republican Party was formed in 1854, the <em>ISZ</em> became a firm supporter, and &#8220;the leading Republican paper of the Northwest.&#8221; Even though most German immigrants at the time were Democrats, the <em>ISZ</em> grew rapidly, and within a decade, it became the biggest German-language paper west of New York.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnton C. Hesing bought the paper in 1867. He brought Hermann Raster, a well-known correspondent from the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87067019/\"><em>New Yorker Abend-Zeitung</em></a>, aboard as editor, and the two of them began an effort to use the <em>ISZ</em> to convince German Americans to support Republicans. The pair became major players in the Illinois Republican Party, especially Hesing, who acted as the political boss for Chicago Germans from the 1860s to 1875. The first German to hold elected office in Illinois, Hesing leveraged his power to put Germans in city and county offices, combat nativism, and push Republicans towards repealing liquor laws. Alcohol control was an especially strong point of contention: in 1872, Hesing and Raster forced the Republican Party to adopt an anti-Prohibition platform if they wanted the German vote. The resulting declaration of the &#8220;right to drink what one pleases&#8221; became known as the Raster resolution.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThough the <em>ISZ</em>&#8216;s political influence declined after the 1870s, it enjoyed steady growth throughout the end of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth. The paper reached its peak circulation in 1915, publishing 50,000 papers a day. Unfortunately, World War I and the resulting anti-German sentiment sent the <em>ISZ</em> into a massive downward spiral: within three years, the paper lost 10,000 subscribers and most of its advertisers. Part of this was due to the <em>ISZ</em> favoring Germany in the war; former president Theodore Roosevelt attacked it as &#8220;German propaganda.&#8221; Though the paper rebuked this statement and later supported the United States, the financial damage was done, and the Staats-Zeitung Corporation suspended business in June 1918. In October, the <em>ISZ</em> was sold, and daily publication resumed for &#8220;government purposes&#8221; of reaching citizens who only spoke German. This revival was short-lived: from March to November 1921, it was suspended again and sold. That December, it had its final death-knell when Editor Arthur Lorenz wrote an article harshly criticizing the American Legion, an association of WWI veterans. Fewer than ten days later, he was arrested, charged with libel, and recommended for deportation. This was more than the ailing paper could stand. In 1922, the <em>ISZ</em> finally folded and was incorporated into the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045558/\"><em>Deutsch-Amerikanische B&#252;rger-Zeitung</em></a>.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tAberdeen is the largest city in Grays Harbor County (known as Chehalis County until 1915), situated on the central Washington coast. Named for Aberdeen, Scotland, the city is located at the confluence of the Chehalis and Wishkah Rivers, just east of Grays Harbor itself. The first white farmers settled in the area in the 1860s; in the following decades, Aberdeen blossomed into an industrial city that boasted numerous sawmills and salmon canneries. By the 1920s Aberdeen declared itself &#8220;The Lumber Capital of the World,&#8221; but the following decades saw a decline in industrial activity, the economic effects of which are still felt today.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHunt and Kaylor&#8217;s <em>Washington, West of the Cascades</em> (1917) describes the <em>Aberdeen Herald</em> as the city&#8217;s first newspaper. Politically, the paper supported the Democratic Party. According to J. Orin Oliphant&#8217;s &#8220;Newspapers of Washington Territory,&#8221; the weekly <em>Herald</em> started publication on October 20, 1886, under 18-year-old Harford Charles &#8220;Harry&#8221; Telfer. In 1887, according to <em>Ayer&#8217;s</em> <em>Directory of Newspapers</em>, control passed to Edward C. Finch, a real estate man who ran the paper for one year before leaving to found the rival <a href=\"/item/sn90098840/\"><em>Aberdeen Bulletin</em></a>. For a short period beginning in 1889, the paper was called the <em>Aberdeen Weekly Herald</em>. Over the next decade, under a series of editors, the paper&#8217;s circulation dwindled, amounting to just 450 readers by 1897. In 1898, the <em>Herald</em> was acquired by one of Grays Harbor&#8217;s most prominent citizens, John J. Carney, a pioneering Aberdeen sawmill operator, merchant, and land developer who had become the town&#8217;s postmaster and then editor of the <a href=\"/item/sn87093214/\"><em>Elma Chronicle</em></a> and the <a href=\"/item/sn87093199/\"><em>Washington Economist</em></a>. Carney merged the <em>Economist</em> with the <em>Herald</em> and went on to lead the paper longer than any other man, serving as editor and publisher until the <em>Herald</em>&#8217;s demise on July 1, 1917, with the exception of a short period in 1915 when John A. Stimson served as editor. From about 1904 until about 1911, the paper was published twice a week.

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tLocated in Washington County in the Blue Ridge Highlands region of Southwestern Virginia and named after the ancestral home of Martha Washington, the town of Abingdon lays claim to a rich publishing history. In November 1839, John W. Lampkin and Charles B. Coale formed a partnership and began publishing the <a href=\"/item/sn84038729\"><em>South-Western Virginian</em></a>, previously called the <a href=\"/item/sn84038704\"><em>People&#8217;s Friend</em></a> under John N. Humes. On September 4, 1841, Coale formed a new joint venture with George R. Barr, and they continued to operate the four-page weekly, renaming it the <em>Abingdon Virginian</em> in 1849. During the 1850s the <em>Virginian </em>employed one of its more notable writers, James Dabney McCabe, Jr. Author of the popular Confederate drama, <em>The Guerillas</em>, McCabe briefly wrote for the paper when he was only 14 while his father was rector of Holston Parish.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs editor and publisher of the <em>Abingdon Virginian</em>, Coale, a native of Bel Air, Maryland, supported the Whig party and various community endeavors, including the construction of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (V&amp;T), which was to pass through Abingdon and run from Lynchburg, Virginia, to Bristol, Tennessee.The completion of this line transformed the economy of Southwestern Virginia. Rather than raising crops primarily for local consumption, farmers in the region began selling their products to the cities in Virginia&#8217;s Tidewater region. During the Civil War, the V&amp;T became an essential transportation link for Confederacy, hauling troops, weapons, and supplies, including most of the salt and lead used by the Confederate army mined from nearby Smyth and Wythe Counties.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs the Civil War approached, Coale, who owned no slaves, was opposed to secession until Virginia officially joined the Confederacy in April 1861. Once Virginia made its allegiance clear, his newspaper wholly supported the Confederate cause. Its proximity to the rich natural resources in the area and the fact that the V &amp; T ran through it made Abingdon one of several Southwestern Virginia towns coveted by the Union army, but it was not until December 1864 that Union general Stephen Burbridge was able to occupy it successfully. After the occupation, a Union soldier under Burbridge&#8217;s command, Captain James Wyatt, set much of Abingdon&#8217;s Main Street ablaze, resulting in a suspension of the <em>Virginian</em> from December 15, 1864 until December 1865.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1873, Coale and Barr sold the paper to Major G. R. Dunn. &#8220;With this issue of the <em>Virginian</em> closes the editorial career of the undersigned,&#8221; their farewell column explained. &#8220;A little over thirty-three years ago, without one dollar of capital and with a debt of $2,500 hanging over us for printing material, we took charge of the <em>Virginian</em>.&#8221; Coale and Barr went on to graciously thank their readers saying, &#8220;When we look back over the long road we have plodded, with its ascents and descents, its rugged gorges and its windings, we forget all in reflecting upon the liberal support and kind indulgence of our subscribers.&#8221; Coale&#8217;s absence from publishing was not permanent though, and three years after his retirement from the <em>Virginian</em>, he began publishing the <a href=\"/item/sn90069189\"><em>Abingdon</em> <em>Standard</em></a>. In addition to his newspaper career, Coale authored<em> The Life and Adventures of Wilburn Waters: The Famous Hunter and Trapper of White Top Mountain</em> published in 1878. The <em>Abingdon Virginian </em>continued to be published in various incarnations until the 1970s.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe written Navajo language was becoming standardized when the newspaper <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92024097/\"><em>&#193;dahoon&#237;&#322;&#237;g&#237;&#237;</em></a> (&#8220;Current Events&#8221;) debuted in August 1943. Subtitled the <em>Navajo Language Monthly</em>, the newspaper&#8217;s home was in Window Rock, Arizona, on the Navajo Indian Reservation and was printed by the U.S. Indian School in Phoenix. Initially, articles on the front page were in the Navajo language, <em>Din&#233; bizaad</em>, followed by a few pages of English translations. As the paper grew, more articles were written in Navajo with short summaries in English on the last page, and then later the English summaries were listed after each article written in Navajo.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe newspaper was initially led by Editor Robert W. Young, a linguist who worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and translated by William Morgan, a Navajo Indian. Together, Young and Morgan had published the dictionary, <em>The Navajo Language</em>, in 1943. Morgan was translator of the newspaper throughout its entire run. In a 2001 tribute to Morgan in the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86091573/\"><em>Navajo Times</em></a>, Young said that Morgan &#8220;drafted the Navajo texts&#8221; and Young &#8220;set the type and supervised distribution&#8221; of <em>&#193;dahoon&#237;&#322;&#237;g&#237;&#237;</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the first two years of publication, a slogan was included in the masthead: <em>&#8220;Ihoo&#8217;aah biniigh&#233;, t&#8217;&#225;&#225; h&#243; honits&#233;kees bik&#8217;ehgo na&#8217;ad&#225; biniigh&#233;, d&#243;&#243; n&#225;&#225;s &#8217;adooldah biniigh&#233;&#8221;</em>. The English translation in the paper read: &#8220;For Education, For Liberty, and For Progress.&#8221; Much of the news during this time was about World War II, both information about events overseas, as well as the impact on the Navajo community, such as an article about Navajo Sergeant Tim Touchin being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and a photograph of two Navajo code talkers. News from around the Navajo Reservation also filled the paper, from reporting on the Tribal Council to articles on agriculture, schools, and public health.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t<em>&#193;dahoon&#237;&#322;&#237;g&#237;&#237;</em> suspended publication between January 1944 and November 1946. The <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86091251/\"><em>Arizona Daily Sun</em></a> reported that the Navajo newspaper had been discontinued during World War II. When it resumed in 1946, the newspaper grew from four pages to as many as sixteen. Some issues included a section on the Navajo alphabet, with examples of words in Navajo and English. There was more news about Indian Schools in Arizona and other states, tribal news like election results and resolutions passed by the council, and information about federal policies affecting Navajos. These longer issues regularly included several pages of photographs from around the Reservation, sometimes reprinted from <em>Arizona Highways</em> magazine. In its April 1948 issue, the newspaper announced that it would start including more articles written by Navajo Indians.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBy April 1951, Young had left the paper, and Morgan briefly served as editor before R. Ethelyn Miller joined the newspaper until the end of 1951. Leon Wall became editor in 1952 and stayed at the paper for over four years, followed by Edward Mays. In its last few years, the newspaper was occasionally published every other month until becoming bimonthly from September 1956 to June 1957, when <em>&#193;dahoon&#237;&#322;&#237;g&#237;&#237;</em> ceased publication. At the time, the newspaper stated that 3,500 copies were being printed.</p>',\n",

       "  'essay': '<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> (1884-87) was one of several short-lived newspapers that arose in Abbeville County, South Carolina, in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century to challenge the dominance of the leading weekly papers, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026853/\"><em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn84026854/\"><em>Abbeville Medium</em></a>. The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> began as the <a href=\"/item/sn93067741/\"><em>Greenwood Saluda Argus</em></a> in 1881. Although only a few issues of the <em>Saluda Argus </em>have survived, contemporary sources depict it as a struggling enterprise. In 1884, Milledge Lipscomb Bonham, James Sumter Perrin, and Thomas Perrin Cothran purchased the <em>Saluda Argus</em> and renamed it the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em>. The first issue appeared on October 1, 1884.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDespite receiving accolades from other South Carolina newspapers, including the influential weekly <a href=\"/item/sn84026897/\"><em>Edgefield Advertiser</em></a>, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> never established a niche among its competitors. In 1885, the <em>American Newspaper Directory</em> recorded only 510 subscribers (that same year, the <em>Abbeville Medium</em> and <em>Abbeville Press and Banner</em> boasted 900 and 816 subscribers, respectively). On January 13, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn84026965/\"><em>Anderson Intelligencer</em></a> announced that Bonham had turned over his share of responsibilities to Cothran. On July 20, 1887, the <a href=\"/item/sn93067846/\"><em>Sumter Watchman and Southron</em></a> reported that the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> had ceased publication. Its failure was attributed &#8220;to the fact that Abbeville County cannot support three good papers at the county seat.&#8221;&#160; The latest known surviving issue is dated June 28, 1887.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom a historical perspective, the <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> is particularly interesting given the accomplishments of its proprietors. Prior to moving to Abbeville, Bonham had edited the <a href=\"/item/sn93067775/\"><em>Ninety-Six Guardian</em></a> and <a href=\"/item/sn92065592/\"><em>Newberry News</em></a>. He served as adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina (1886-91) and an associate justice (1931-40) and chief justice (1940-43) in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Cothran served as a state representative (1905-10, 1915-17), Speaker of the House (1918-21), and an associate justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court (1921-34). Perrin went on to practice law and serve as vice-president of the Citizens Bank and Trust Company in Yazoo City, Mississippi. The <em>Abbeville Messenger</em> may have failed, but for Bonham, Cothran, and Perrin it was merely a minor stumbling block in their careers.</p>',\n",

A general agricultural advice column was supplemented by separate columns on poultry, livestock, and gardening; additionally, in 1915 the paper published a series of fourteen articles from the United States Department of Agriculture entitled &#8220;The Home Garden of the South.&#8221; A fashion column and &#8220;Progress Woman&#8217;s Page&#8221; were targeted at women readers, as was much of the paper&#8217;s selection of fiction.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe <em>Abbeville Progress </em>published the minutes of the parish police jury (the equivalent of county councils in other states) after it became the official journal of Vermilion Parish in 1917. It was also the official journal of the parish school board and frequently reported on local events associated with the Chautauqua adult education movement. Information on the early oil industry in south Louisiana is minimal but of some interest. News of World War I was published in a &#8220;Weekly War News Digest.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1915, O&#8217;Bryan purchased John Milton Scanland&#8217;s <em>Vermilion News</em> and consolidated it with the <em>Abbeville Progress</em>. He continued as editor and proprietor until his death in 1943, whereupon the business was carried on by his wife and sons. John O&#8217;Bryan, Jr., was killed in 1944 while serving in World War II. His family, feeling unable to carry on, sold the paper the following year to the <a href=\"/item/sn88064004/\"><em>Abbeville Meridional</em></a>.</p>',\n",
